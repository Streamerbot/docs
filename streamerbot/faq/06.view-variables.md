description: How do I know which variables are available?

The easiest way would be to check out the [Streamer.bot docs](/api) and look for the trigger or subaction you are using. A full list of variables will be given there, e.g. [Twitch Follow trigger](/api/triggers/twitch/channel/follow).

A second method would be to run the action, then go into the **Action Queues** tab, into the **Action History** and then doubleclick the action that has run. This will give you all variables that have been populated.
