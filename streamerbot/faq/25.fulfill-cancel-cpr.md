description: How can I automatically fulfill/refund a channel point reward?
---

This is done with a `Twitch -> Rewards -> Update Redemption Status` subaction. This subaction requires the `rewardId` and `redemptionId`, those automatically come with the `Twitch -> Channel Reward -> Reward Redemption` trigger.

In the settings for the channel point rewards (`Platforms -> Twitch -> Channel Point Rewards`) you will have to make sure that the reward is **owned** by StreamerBot. StreamerBot owns them if they have been created in there. This also makes them editable. Also make sure that `Redemptions Skips Queue` stays **unchecked** in the reward settings.
