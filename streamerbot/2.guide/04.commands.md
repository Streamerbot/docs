Chat commands in Streamer.bot are **platform-agnostic**, supporting Twitch, YouTube and Trovo.

Configuration options give you fine-grained control over command text parsing, cooldowns, and user permissions.

    ::warning

    ::
  ::

  ::field{name=Enabled type=Toggle default=true}
    Toggle this command on or off
  ::

  ::field{name=Include type=Toggle default=true}
    Include this command in the [Get Commands](/api/sub-actions/core/commands/get-commands) sub-action
  ::

  ::field{name=Mode type=Select required}
    Select a text matching mode for this command:

    - `Basic` - Match at least one of the strings entered, based on the configured `Location` option
    - `Regex` - Match based on Regular Expression
  ::

  ::field{name=Location type=Select}
    Modify the text matching behavior when using the `Basic` mode:

    - `Start` - Match chat messages that **begin with** at least one command alias
    - `Exact` - Match chat messages that are **exactly** the same text as at least one command alias
    - `Anywhere` - Match chat messages that **contain** at least one command alias

### Cooldowns
To prevent spam or generally restrict usage of your command, you can configure cooldown options:

::field-group
  ::field{name="Global Cooldown" type="Number" default=0}
  Enter a minimum time, in seconds, before the command can be used by **anyone** again after it is executed

  - Set to `0` to disable global cooldowns
  ::
  ::field{name="User Cooldown" type="Number" default=0}
  Enter a minimum time, in seconds, before the command can be used by **a specific user** again after it is executed by that user

  - Set to `0` to disable user cooldowns
  ::
::

::warning
**The Broadcaster Account is always exempt from cooldowns.** If you are testing this feature, ensure you use a different account.
::

### Permissions
::warning
By default, commands can be executed by **anyone** in chat.
::

You can restrict access to your commands by configuring permissions options:

::field-group
  ::field{name="Grant Type" type=Select}
  Modify the grant type for all configured permissions within this command:

  - `Allow` - Only the specified groups or users can execute this command
  - `Deny` - Everyone **except** the specified groups or users can execute this command
  ::

  ::warning
    If the `Allowed` or `Denied` fields are left empty, the permission applies to **everyone**.
    - Grant type `Allow`, with an empty `Allowed` field will **allow all users** access
    - Grant type `Deny` with an empty `Denied` field will **deny all users** access
  ::
::

::warning
**The Broadcaster Account is always exempt from permission settings.** If you are testing this feature, ensure you use a different account.
