description: Configuration of actions, sub-actions, and queues
---

## Introduction
Perhaps the most important piece of Streamer.bot, actions are at the center of everything you do.

You can configure actions for anything from basic alerts and shoutouts to extremely complex integrations such as TerrierDart's [Leaderboard Points System](https://extensions.streamer.bot/docs?topic=67){target=_blank}

Actions consist of configurable sets of [sub-actions](#sub-actions) that can be executed by Streamer.bot's event sources, such as [Triggers](/guide/triggers), [Commands](/guide/commands), various integrations such as [Elgato Stream Deck](/guide/integrations/elgato-stream-deck), and even [your own voice](/guide/voice-control)!

Sub-actions even have the ability to trigger other actions, giving you the ability to **organize** significant pieces of your setup into consolidated sections, and share logic across multiple event sources.

As sub-actions are executed, another important feature of Streamer.bot comes into play, the **argument stack**, which consists of all [variables](/guide/variables) available at a given time.

Each sub-action has the ability to populate new variables for upcoming sub-actions, read existing variables from earlier sub-actions, or even modify them on the fly!

## Actions

::navigate
To get started, navigate to **Actions** in Streamer.bot
::

![Streamer.bot Actions Configuration](assets/streamerbot-actions.png)

The actions tab is split into 3 main parts:

1. `Actions` - All of your configured actions are listed here, sorted by group
2. `Triggers` - All triggers configured for the selected action will be listed here
3. `Sub-Actions` - All sub-actions configured for the selected action will be listed here

#### Configuration
To create your first action, :kbd{value="Right-Click"} in the actions pane and select `Add` to open the configuration dialog

![Add Action Dialog](assets/add-action.png){caption-alt}

#### Options
::field-group
  ::field{name=Name type=Text required}
    The friendly name the action will be referred as throughout the bot
  ::
  ::field{name=Group type=Text default=None}
    Optionally type or select a group name.

    This is used to organize similar actions into collapsible sections to keep the interface clean if you have a large number of actions
  ::
  ::field{name=Queue type=Select required default=Default}
    Assign this action to an [Action Queue](#action-queues)

    ::warning
    The `Default` queue is configured as a **non-blocking** queue, meaning actions will execute immediately on request and are allowed to run concurrently.
    ::
    ::read-more{to=#action-queues}
    Learn more about [Action Queues](#action-queues) below
    ::
  ::
  ::field{name=Enabled type=Toggle default=true}
    Toggle this action on or off
  ::
  ::field{name="Random Action (RA)" type=Toggle default=true}
    Randomly execute a single sub-action from within this action
    ::warning
    Sub-action groups will be treated as a **single entity** and will execute as if they were a standalone action.
    ::
    ::tip
    This option enables the `Weight` configuration on sub-actions, allowing you to adjust the probability that specific sub-actions will be chosen.
    ::
  ::
  ::field{name="Concurrent (CC)" type=Toggle default=true}
    Execute all sub-actions in this action simultaneously, rather than waiting for each step to complete.
    ::warning
    This will also **ignore** the [Delay](/api/sub-actions/core/delay) sub-action
    ::
  ::
  ::field{name="Always Run" type=Toggle default=true}
    Force this action to execute even if the queue is in a `Paused` state
  ::
  ::field{name="Exclude from Action Queue Pending/History" type=Toggle default=true}
    Exclude this action from being logged to the action history.
    ::tip
    This option is recommended for frequently executed actions to improve performance of your bot
    ::

## Action Queues
In Streamer.bot, all actions exist within a queue. The `Default` queue is created automatically and will contain all action executions unless specified otherwise.

### Queues
::navigate
To get started, navigate to **Action Queues > Queues** in Streamer.bot
::

![queues tab](assets/queues.png){caption="Action Queues > Queues View"}

In this section, you will find all the queues that have been created.

At a glance, you can view the status of several queue properties:

- `Pending Count`: Number of actions waiting to be executed within the respective queue
- `Completed Count`: Number of actions that have completed execution within the respective queue
  - This includes actions that have been cancelled - learn more in [Action History](#action-history)
- `Paused`: Shows the current paused status of this queue
- `Blocking`: Shows whether the queue is configured as a `Blocking` queue

#### Context Menu
You can :kbd{value="Right-Click"} within the Queues pane to reveal the context menu:

![Action Queues Context Menu](assets/queues-context-menu.png){caption-alt}

#### Options
::field-group
  ::field{name=Add type=Action}
  Create a new Queue, [configuration detailed below](#configuration-1)

  ::

  ::field{name="Pause/Resume" type=Action}
  This option displays the current action you can perform on the queue.

  - Available if you :kbd{value="Right-Click"} on a specific queue
  - If the queue is currently `Paused`, you can select `Resume` to restart a queue and trigger any pending actions.
  - If the queue is currently `Active`, you can select `Pause` to temporarily stop new actions from being triggered in that queue. Once resumed, pending actions will be processed.
  ::

  ::field{name=Blocking type=Toggle}
  Toggle the `Blocking` state of the selected queue.

  If selected, check mark will appear beside `Blocking`, indicating that the queue will execute actions in sequence.

  - Available if you :kbd{value="Right-Click"} on a specific queue
  ::

  ::field{name=Clear type=Action}
  Clears the selected queue of any pending actions.

  - Available if you :kbd{value="Right-Click"} on a specific queue
  ::

  ::field{name="Pause All Queues" type=Action}
  Immediately pause all queues.
  - Available if you :kbd{value="Right-Click"} on a specific queue
  - Available if you :kbd{value="Right-Click"} an empty space of Queues area
  ::

  ::field{name="Resume All Queues" type=Action}
  Immediately resume any queues which are currently paused.
  - Available if you :kbd{value="Right-Click"} on a specific queue

  ::
::

#### Configuration
To create a new queue, :kbd{value="Right-Click"} within the queues pane and select `Add`

![create queue dialog](assets/queue-create-dialog.png){caption="Add/Edit Queue Dialog"}

#### Options
::field-group
  ::field{name=Name type=Text required}
  Enter a descriptive name for your new queue
  ::

  ::field{name=Blocking type=Toggle default=false}
    By default, all queues execute actions immediately, with no wait.

    To execute actions in sequence, waiting for each previous action to complete, you can enable the `Blocking` option.

    ::tip
    It's especially useful to have a blocking queue for **alerts**, to allow them to execute one at a time!
    ::
  ::
::




### Pending Actions
The pending actions view will display any queued actions which are waiting to run.

::tip
When utilizing blocking queues, as all currently blocked actions will show here.
::


### Action History

The action history view will display a log of all actions that have been executed by Streamer.bot

::tip
Action History is the best place to discover what [variables](/guide/variables) are available within your action!
::

![Action Queues > Action History View](assets/queue-action-history.png){caption-alt}

At a glance, you can view the following properties:


- `Name`: The name of the executed action
- `State`: The current status of the executed action
  - e.g. `Completed`, `Cancelled`, `Pending`
- `Variables`: The number of variables populated by this action
- `Duration`: Time, in milliseconds, the action took to finish execution
- `Queue`: The name of the queue this action was executed in
- `Queued At`: The date and time the action was initially queued for execution
- `Started At`: The date and time the action began execution
