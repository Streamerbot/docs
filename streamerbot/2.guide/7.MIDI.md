description: Configure MIDI I/O with Streamer.bot
---

## Introduction
Streamer.bot ships with full MIDI input & output support, allowing you to execute your actions with the push of a button using your existing MIDI device, or even let your bot take control of your devices by using sub-actions to send outgoing MIDI commands.

## Devices
::callout{icon=i-mdi-navigation}
**In Streamer.bot**, navigate to the **MIDI** tab
::

::callout{icon=i-mdi-lightbulb color=amber}
`MIDI In` and `MIDI Out` devices are stored separately, so be sure to navigate to the appropriate tab for the type of interactions you would like to make. You can also add the same device in both tabs.
::

To add a new device, :shortcut{value="Right-Click"} anywhere in the device pane and select `Add`

![Add Device Context Menu](assets/midi-add-device.png)

This will open the add device dialog:

  ::
  ::field{name=Device type=Select required}

## MIDI In

Once you have created a `MIDI In` device, you can select it to register your incoming event listeners in the bottom pane.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
Make sure the device is currently connected. You can manually :shortcut{value="Right-Click"} the device and select `Open`
::


With your device selected in the top pane, you can :shortcut{value="Right-Click"} on bottom pane and select `Add` to create a new event listener.

You can now **automatically generate** the event configuration by triggering an event from your MIDI device

- Press a pad
- Turn a dial, knob, or wheel
- Press any button which sends a MIDI message
::

### Configuration

  ::field{name=Name type=Text required}
  Enter a descriptive name for this event listener
  - Automatic detection is supported

  ::field{name=Command type=Text required}
  Select the MIDI event type you would like to listen to
  - Automatic detection is supported
  ::
  ::field{name=Channel type=Number required}

  ::field{name="Ignore Data" type=Toggle}
