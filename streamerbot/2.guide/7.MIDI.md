description: Configure MIDI I/O with Streamer.bot
---

## Introduction
Streamer.bot ships with full MIDI input & output support, allowing you to execute your actions with the push of a button using your existing MIDI device, or even let your bot take control of your devices by using sub-actions to send outgoing MIDI commands.

## Devices
::callout{icon=i-mdi-navigation}
**In Streamer.bot**, navigate to the **MIDI** tab
::

::callout{icon=i-mdi-lightbulb color=amber}
`MIDI In` and `MIDI Out` devices are stored separately, so be sure to navigate to the appropriate tab for the type of interactions you would like to make. You can also add the same device in both tabs.
::

To add a new device, :shortcut{value="Right-Click"} anywhere in the device pane and select `Add`

![Add Device Context Menu](assets/midi-add-device.png)

This will open the add device dialog:
