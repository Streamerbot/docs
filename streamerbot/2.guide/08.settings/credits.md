In this tab, you will be able to see all of the available events to include in your end Credits.

## Events to Record
These are various events that happen during your stream, select the ones that you care to show off at the end, or perhaps use it as a way to give extra 'Thanks' to those who supported you.

You can select one, all, or any event that you wish to include. There are no minimum or maximum number of events required to make the credits work.
