## Backup Archive
2 types of Backup are created : Data Backup & App Backup

### Data Backup
These types of backups are created on every startup, each shutdown, and when you click the `save` button. They are formatted as follows: 'backup-date-time.zip'.
It contains files from your data folder such as actions, settings, databases and more.

### App Backup
These are only created when an [Update](/guide/update) is installed via the inbuilt update process. They follow the following format 'app-backup-version-date-time.zip' and contain the program files necessary for Streamer.bot to run.

## Restore a Backup
### Restore Data
Close streamer.bot to ensure there are no conflicts during the process. Navigate to your Streamer.bot directory, then into your backup folder. To restore an earlier version, open a backup zip that was created before the last one. Copy its contents. Return to your Streamer.bot directory, then into your data folder. Paste the contents into this folder.

You can also open in a new window the folder containing the files to be replaced, juxtapose them next to the main streamer.bot folder to drag and drop directly into the necessary locations. This is the method used in the video below.

If a 'Replace or Skip Files' menu opens, click on 'Replace the file in the destination'.

You can now try starting up Streamer.bot again, sometimes you might need to restore an earlier version, especially if an error persists.

### Rollback to an earlier version 
::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
You might need to do this when an update fails and it did not revert back to the old version.
We always recommend to stay on the latest update unless absolutely necessary.

Close Streamer.bot to ensure a smooth transition during the restoration process, head over to the backup folder in your Streamer.bot directory.

Once the 'app-backup' zip file is located, note the date and time contained in its name. This will be necessary later to also restore the corresponding 'data' folder. Open the 'app-backup' zip file, copy its contents, and paste them into the main folder of streamer.bot. Go back to the 'backup' folder and open the 'backup-data' folder that corresponds to the date of the 'app-back' file. Copy its contents, then, from the main streamer.bot folder, navigate to the 'data' folder and paste the files there.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-lightbulb color=amber}
You can also open in two new windows the folders containing the files to be replaced, juxtapose them next to the main streamer.bot folder to drag and drop directly into the necessary locations. This is the method used in the video below.

If everything was done correctly, you can go ahead and close the backup windows and start up Streamer.bot again.
