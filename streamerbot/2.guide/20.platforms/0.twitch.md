## Channel Point Rewards
Streamer.bot can automatically execute your actions when a Channel Point Reward is redeemed by a user.

When the Broadcaster account is connected, Streamer.bot will automatically pull a list of currently configured rewards from the account, making them immediately available as [Reward Redemption](/api/triggers/twitch/channel-reward/reward-redemption) triggers.

You can also `Add` or `Delete` rewards directly from Streamer.bot, with all changes immediately reflected on Twitch.
