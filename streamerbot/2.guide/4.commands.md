description: Define and configure your chat commands

Chat commands in Streamer.bot are **platform agnostic**, supporting both Twitch and YouTube.

Configuration options give you fine-grained control over command text parsing, cooldowns, and user permissions.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-navigation}
To get started, navigate to **Commands** in Streamer.bot
::

![Commands Pane](assets/commands.png)

To create your first command, <kbd>Right-click</kbd> in commands pnae and select `Add` to open the configuration dialog.

## Configuration

::field-group
  ::field{name=Name type=Text required}
    Enter a friendly name for this command

    ::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
    This can be any label to recognize your command with. The actual text used for command execution will be defined in the `Commands` field.
    ::
  ::

  ::field{name=Enabled type=Toggle default=true}
    Toggle this command on or off
  ::

  ::field{name=Include type=Toggle default=true}
    Include this command in the [Get Commands](/api/sub-actions/general/commands/get-commands) sub-action
  ::

  ::field{name=Mode type=Select required}
    Select a text matching mode for this command:

    - `Basic` - Match at least one of the strings entered, based on the configured `Location` option
    - `Regex` - Match based on Regular Expression
  ::

  ::field{name=Location type=Select}
    Modify the text matching behavior when using the `Basic` mode:

    - `Start` - Match chat messages that **begin with** at least one command alias
    - `Exact` - Match chat messages that are **exactly** the same text as at least one command alias
    - `Anywhere` - Match chad messages that **contain** at least one command alias
  ::

  ::field{name="Commands" type=Text required}
    Enter the text from chat used to execute this command

    ::callout{icon=i-mdi-lightbulb color=amber}
    You can enter multiple trigger strings or aliases by adding one item per line
    ::
    ::callout{icon=i-mdi-warning color=amber}
    Command cooldowns are **shared across all configured aliases** within a command entity. You should create separate commands if you need exclusive cooldowns for each.
    ::
  ::

  ::field{name=Group type=Text}
  Optionally type or select a group for this command
  ::
::

### Cooldowns
To prevent spam or generally restrict usage of your command, you can configure cooldown options:

::field-group
  ::field{name="Global Cooldown" type="Number" default=0}
  Enter a minimum time, in seconds, before the command can be used by **anyone** again after it is executed

  - Set to `0` to disable global cooldowns
  ::
  ::field{name="User Cooldown" type="Number" default=0}
  Enter a minimum time, in seconds, before the command can be used by **a specific user** again after it is executed by that user

  - Set to `0` to disable user cooldowns
  ::
::

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
**The Broadcaster Account is always exempt from cooldowns.** If you are testing this feature, ensure you use a different account.
::

### Permissions
::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
By default, commands can be executed by **anyone** in chat.
::

You can restrict access to your commands by configuring permissions options:

::field-group
  ::field{name="Grant Type" type=Select}
  Modify the grant type for all configured permissions within this command:

  - `Allow` - Only the specified groups or users can execute this command
  - `Deny` - Everyone **except** the specified groups or users can execute this command
  ::

  ::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
    If the `Allowed` or `Denied` fields are left empty, the permission applies to **everyone**.
    - Grant type `Allow`, with an empty `Allowed` field will **allow all users** access
    - Grant type `Deny` with an empty `Denied` field will **deny all users** access
  ::
::

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
**The Broadcaster Account is always exempt from permission settings.** If you are testing this feature, ensure you use a different account.
