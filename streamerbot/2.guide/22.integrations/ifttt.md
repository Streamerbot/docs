#### Execute Action
The `Execute Action` IFTTT action allows you to execute any action in your Streamer.bot instance along with a configurable text field.

The following arguments will be made available to your Streamer.bot actions:

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`iftttText` | The contents of the `Text` field from your IFTTT applet. This can include any ingredients from other IFTTT supported services in your applet.

#### Execute Action (JSON)
The `Execute Action (JSON)` IFTTT action allows you to execute any action in your Streamer.bot instance with a JSON payload that is automatically parsed into variables for usage in your Streamer.bot sub-actions.

This is extremely useful for connecting generic webhooks with Streamer.bot through the [IFTTT Webhooks Integration](https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks).

All top level keys in the JSON payload passed to this action will be available as variables in Streamer.bot

For example, the following JSON payload...
```json
{ "test": "some value", "test2": "some other value" }
```
...will be transformed into the variables `test` and `test2`, which will be populated with their respective values.
