## Introduction

This is a starter pack for anyone wanting to get started using Streamer.bot. It contains a wide range of extensions for you to use, including alerts, a point system, a death counter and many other features.

This package was built as a part of a raid train streamed live on Twitch, in celebration of Streamer.bot's 3rd birthday on August 24, 2024.

::changelog-list{type=new}
- Added **Wheel of Fortune**
::

> During the Raid Train 2024 dedicated to Streamer.bot's (SB) birthday, I added the extension called 'Wheel of Fortune' into the SB instance.
It is fully customizable and allows users to modify everything from size, colours, and number of items on the wheel itself to functionality/reward/response of each item.
It uses Vue.js for the wheel functionality and WebSockets protocol for the communication between SB and the wheel.

#### Setup
The whole setup was shown during the raid train on my Twitch live-stream.
It consists of the retrieving HTML, CSS and JS files for the wheel and allowing WebSockets within the SB on the correct port.
Also, here is the link to my own documentation page, where I will post updated version*s of this extension.

### ConfuzzedCat
:social-links{twitch="confuzzedcat"}

::changelog-list{type=new}
- Added **Walk-on Message and Sound** action
::

> My entry to Raid Train Bot is a 'Walk-on Message and Sound' using C#.
This will play both a sound and send a message when some joins your stream, if they have one.
If a sound is found but no message, then it will only play the sound.
If a message is found but no sound, then it will only send the message.
If both is found then it play the sound and send the message.

#### Configuration
There is 4 variables you can change.

| Variable | Type | Description |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| `enableSound`{lang=cs} | `bool`{lang=cs} | Controls globally if Walk-on Sound should play. If true it will play the sound (if found), and false wont play anything (even if the file exist). |
| `enableMessage`{lang=cs} | `bool`{lang=cs} | Controls globally if Walk-on Message should be sent. If true it will send the message (if found), and false wont send anything (even if the file exist). |
| `rootPath`{lang=cs} | `string`{lang=cs} | The file system path where all the sounds and messages for each should be stored. <br> Example: `C:\users\<user>\Desktop\WalkOnSoundsAndMessages`{lang=cs} <br><br> Note: It will look for a folder, with the username as name, eg. `C:\users\<user>\Desktop\WalkOnSoundsAndMessages\ConfuzzedCat`{lang=cs}, it uses `%user%`{lang=cs} or the display name of the twitch user. <br><br> Note 2: To add a sound and/or message for a given user, got to you selected root path, create a folder with the given user's display name, and add the sound and message and rename them to `sound.mp3` and `message.txt`. |
| `excludedUsers`{lang=cs} | `string`{lang=cs} | Comma separated list of all the users you want to exlcude from the Walk-on, e.g. bots and yourself. <br>Example: `ConfuzzedCat,Confuzzedbot`{lang=cs} |

> If you need more help, check first Streamer.bot's Discord, if someone doesn't already had the same issue, else create a post in support and @ me (@ConfuzzedCat).

### Mustached_Maniac
:social-links{twitch="mustached_maniac" website="https://www.mustachedmaniac.com"}

::changelog-list{type="new"}
- Added **BRB Clip Player**
- Added **Video Shoutouts**
- Added **Chat Lockdown**
::

> I added 3 different tools to the Streamer.bot raid train, a 'BRB Clip Player', 'Video Shoutouts', and a 'Chat Lockdown' function.

#### BRB Clip Player
Functions as the name implies, but has some customization options as well.  Can be set to play when a certain scene is active and/or with a a command `!brb` & `!brb stop`.  The 'Test' Trigger will automagically add the OBS Scene/Source for you and then you just have to nest it where you'd like to use it.

::read-more{to="https://www.mustachedmaniac.com/twitch-extensions/brb-clip-player"}
A full installation guide and walkthrough can be found here
::

#### Video Shoutouts
Like the 'BRB Clip Player' Add-On, the 'Test' Trigger will add the necessary assets.  Once the Scene/Source are in OBS, you only need to nest the scene wherever you'd like to use it.  It will work out of the box, or offers customization options for videos, length, even the chat message.

::read-more{to="https://www.mustachedmaniac.com/twitch-extensions/video-shoutouts"}
A full installation guide and walkthrough can be found here
::

#### Chat Lockdown
This is a very simple inclusion that simply prevents users from typing things in your chat when you're offline by enabling Slow Mode, Emote Only, Subscriber Only, and Shield Mode once the broadcast ends.  On `Broadcast Start`, they are all disabled and the chat functions as it normally would.

### OSUPhoenix
:social-links{twitch="osuphoenix"}

::changelog-list{type="new"}
- Added **OSUPhoenix Alerts**
- Added **Retro Game Alerts**
- Added **QR Code Generator**
::

> At the end of the Raid Train, I added two different alert packages and my QR Code Generator.

#### OSUPhoenix Alerts
For OSUPhoenix's Alerts (OBS Standard Alert), You will need to import the General OBS Alert json file to OBS to import the scene. Then in Streamer.bot, simply enable all the triggers you wish to use for this alert. Easy peasy!

#### Retro Game Alerts
For the Retro Game Alerts, these come with video files. Save the video files somewhere on your PC. I recommend adding a folder named "assets" into your OBS Studio folder for safe keeping. Next, import the "All Retro Game Alerts" json into OBS. It should install 4 scenes. For SNES, NES, and Genesis Scenes, find the [V] (name) Cart source and change each to the cooresponding video file you saved to your PC (i.e. NES to NES) to load the proper path. The ]I] YOUR LOGO HERE source, double click and change the image file to your logo.
In Streamer.bot, enable the triggers you wish to use under each. If you want all randomly triggered by anything, enable all triggers under All Random. If you want your follower alert to be just the SNES Cart, enable only the follow only under the SNES cart. BE CAREFUL NOT TO DUPLICATE ENABLED TRIGGERS! If two actions have the same trigger enabled, it will not function properly. Make sure you double check when picking and choosing your triggers.

**Retro Game Alerts Tutorial**
::

#### QR Code Generator
This is an action that can be used for Shoutouts, Alerts, or anything else you might want to use it with. Each setting has a description above it helping you to set up how you want. When setting the %savePath%, make sure you have the address correct and the file name with extension (.png) at the end.
Add an image source in OBS Studio that points to where your QR Code image is saved. Everytime the image is updated, the source should change the displaying image.
To add this to a shoutout action, simply add a sub-action CORE>ACTIONS>RUN ACTION and select the QR Code Generator and place it at the beginning of your sub-actions.
NOTE: This is currently set for shoutouts! This is due to "Twitch Add target info from input" that requires a name from your chat. If you are wanting to use this for alerts, you will need to double click, change source type from "From Input" to "User" to properly ensure the information is populating correctly. If done correctly, it should continue to change the QR Code when run.
