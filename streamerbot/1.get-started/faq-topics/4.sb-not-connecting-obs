### 4. Why is my StreamerBot not connecting to OBS?
This can happen for various reasons. First of all make sure that *Enable WebSocket server* is checked in OBS. If StreamerBot and OBS are running on the same PC, use `127.0.0.1` as the IP address, otherwise make sure the Server IP matches (Port number and password have to match as well). If on the same network you can also just deactivate authentication. In rare cases the default port `4455` is already occupied, in that case try to change it to something else, like `4456` or `1234`. Last but not least, make sure to choose `v5.x` on the connection in StreamerBot.
