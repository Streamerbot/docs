### 16. Can StreamerBot change the settings within a filter (like Move Value or Move Source)?
This can be done with an OBS Raw subaction (`OBS -> Raw`) and a [SetSourceFilterSettings request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#SetSourceFilterSettings>). To find out what the correct settings for a request are called, you can manually set the settings on your filter and do a [**Get**SourceFilter request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#GetSourceFilter>) beforehand. This will give you the list of settings.

In this example:

a GetSourceFilter request for a *Move Value* filter with a *Type Writer* effect on a text source was done and returned `"settings_text"`. So we use that in our **Set**SourceFilterSettings request like this:

You can also use variables within the request (__Note__: If you click "Test" on the Raw subaction, the variable **WILL NOT** be populated. In that case you will have to test the entire action).


```json
{
  "requestType": "SetSourceFilterSettings",
  "requestData": {
    "sourceName": "Test Text Source",
    "filterName": "Move Value",
    "filterSettings": {
      "setting_text": "%user% said: %rawInput%"
    },
    "overlay": true
  }
}
```

This can also be done for filters on a scene, but you won’t be able to select it on the OBS Raw website. In that case, do a request in a subaction, use the scene name as the sourceName and hit “Test”.
