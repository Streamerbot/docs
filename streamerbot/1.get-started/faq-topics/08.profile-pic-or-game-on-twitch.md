### 8. How do I get the profile picture or game of a Twitch user?
Those variables are being populated by the *Get User Info For Target* subaction (`Twitch -> User`). For *Source Type* you can then choose between different sources. *User* is the one who redeems the trigger (e.g. the one who follows on a *Follow* trigger or uses the command on a *Command Triggered* trigger). *From Input* uses the `%rawInput%` as the target, so the command  `!command nate1280` would populate the variables for user *nate1280*. Just make sure the command location is set to *Start* in its settings. You can also choose *Variable* and type a variable like `%randomUser0%` in there if you have a preceding *Add Random Viewer* subaction.
