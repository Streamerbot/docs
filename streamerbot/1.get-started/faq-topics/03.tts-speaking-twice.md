### 3. My TTS is speaking twice, why's that?
On rare occasions the UDP broadcast can cause SpeakerBot to speak twice. The next version of StreamerBot (v0.2.3, currently in alpha) will add a websocket speak subaction that won't cause this issue. As for now, a PC restart will fix this. You can also switch to websocket speak subactions via C#,
