description: Can I use math in a subaction?

Yes, you can use [inline functions](/guide/variables#inline-functions) in subactions*.

You can also use any numeric variable in there and then do the math like seen in the picture. If you wanted to convert seconds to milliseconds to use it in a delay subaction, you could do it like this: `$math(%secondsVariable% * 1000)$`

**for some subactions you will need a preceding *Set Argument* subaction (`Core -> Arguments -> Set Argument`) that does the inline math and then use that argument in your other subaction*
