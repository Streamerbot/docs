description: How do I get access to Alpha?
---
Anyone can gain access to the current Alpha version of Streamer.bot by becoming a *Silver Tier* supporter (or higher) on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nate1280/)!

1. Connect your Discord account to both Patreon and the Streamer.bot website
2. Join the [Streamer.bot Discord](https://discord.streamer.bot) server with the same Discord account

After you've ensured both are signed in and connected, head over to the the [Downloads](https://streamer.bot/downloads) section of the website and you will see alpha releases when they are available!

[Automatic Updates](/get-started/installation#automatic-updates) can also be configured to grab alpha releases once you have enabled the Streamer.bot Website Integration within your bot.
