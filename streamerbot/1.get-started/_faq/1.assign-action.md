description: Why can I no longer assign an action to an event?
---

Since update v0.2.0, the actions are no longer assigned in the event, but the other way round. In the `Actions` tab, you will now find a `Triggers` area in which you can select an event/trigger like commands, a subscription, an OBS event and many more triggers for the respective action.
