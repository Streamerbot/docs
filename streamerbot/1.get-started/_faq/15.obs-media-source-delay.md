description: Can I get a dynamic delay of an OBS media source?
---

Yes, this can be done with OBS Raw (`OBS -> Raw`) and a [GetMediaInputStatus request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#GetMediaInputStatus>). Paste the code below into the Raw subaction and replace the inputName with the name of your media source. This request will populate a `%obsRaw.mediaDuration%` variable that gives the media duration in milliseconds. You can then use that variable within the `Delay` subaction.

__Note__: For the variable to populate, the media source needs to be visible. Use a `Set Source Visibility State` subaction to make it visible, add a delay of 100ms and then use the Raw subaction. (Example: [see here](<https://i.imgur.com/mSk7leg.png>))

```json
{
  "requestType": "GetMediaInputStatus",
  "requestData": {
    "inputName": "Your Media Source"
  }
}
```
