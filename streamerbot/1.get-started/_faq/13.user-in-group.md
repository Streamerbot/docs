description: How do I check whether a user is in a group?
---
Since version 0.2.3, platform-specific group sub-actions have been introduced, accessible in the context menu under `User Groups`. If you want to check whether a Twitch user is in a group via sub-actions, navigate to `Twitch -> User Groups -> User In Group`. You can either input a direct username or use a variable such as `%userName%` or `%targetUserName%`, followed by the group name. The sub-action will generate a variable called `inGroup`, which you can utilize in an if/else sub-action (`if inGroup Equals True continue, else break`).

This can also be done in C#. Create a subaction `Core -> C# -> Execute C# Code`) and paste the code below in there. Replace *group1*  with the name of your group. Hit *Save and Compile* afterwards. This will provide the `%inGroup%` variable, that you can then check against in an if/else-subaction (`if inGroup equals True continue, else break`). 
Since 0.2.3, all C# group methods require a platform property, like shown below in the code example.

**After 0.2.3**
```csharp
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        Platform platform = Platform.Twitch; 
        string userId = args["userId"].ToString();
        string groupName = "group1";
        bool inGroup = CPH.UserIdInGroup(userId, platform, groupName);
        CPH.SetArgument("inGroup",inGroup);
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Before 0.2.3**
```csharp
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        string userId = args["userId"].ToString();
        string groupName = "group1";
        bool inGroup = CPH.UserIdInGroup(userId,groupName);
        CPH.SetArgument("inGroup",inGroup);
        return true;
    }
}
```
