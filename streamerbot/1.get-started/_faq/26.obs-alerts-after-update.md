description: Actions are triggering but OBS Alerts are not showing up?
---

After updating Streamer.bot or OBS, some of your OBS alerts are not working correctly anymore? You confirmed that they are running in your action history (`Action Queues -> Action History`), and they also work fine when testing the OBS subactions themselves?

The usual fix for this would be to go to `StreamApps -> OBS`, here you right-click the OBS connection which you are using to display your alerts, then click on `Update All Actions to...`. This will update **ALL** your OBS sub-actions to that specific OBS connection, so be also mindful when you use it. If you don't want to update all your sub-actions you'd have to go to each action and "update" the OBS subaction by re-setting them to the OBS connection again.
