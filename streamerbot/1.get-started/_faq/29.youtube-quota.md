description: What does it mean if the YouTube Quota has been exceeded?
---

In order to use the YouTube API, Streamer.bot has to use a bucket of 'quota' just like any other app. All YouTube features that Streamer.bot has to offer only work as long as quota is available. If the quota is used up, Streamer.bot cannot execute API requests or receive API events. This means that all triggers and subactions will no longer work until the quota is reset. **This reset happens daily at 00:00 PST.**

The quota is not limited to individual users, accounts or Streamer.bot instances, but applies to **all** users at the same time. The more people use Streamer.bot, the faster the quota is used up. Nate, the developer of Streamer.bot, is taking care of increasing Streamer.bot's quota, but Google has to approve this request first â€“ and this may take some time.
