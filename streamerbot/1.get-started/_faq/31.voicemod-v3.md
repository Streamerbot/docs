description: Voicemod 3.0 is not connecting to Streamer.bot

Streamer.bot versions **below 1.0.0** are **only compatible** with Voicemod version **2.51**.

Streamer.bot **v1.0.0 and above require** Voicemod **v3.12 or higher**. Earlier Voicemod versions will not work with SB 1.0.0+

Note: Streamer.bot v1.0.0 is currently in alpha. You can gain alpha access by becoming a *Bronze Tier* supporter (or higher) on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nate1280/)!

## What if I already installed Voicemod v3?
If you're using a version of Streamer.bot below 1.0.0, you'll need to downgrade Voicemod to v2.51 for compatibility.
You can download v2.51 of Voicemod by going to their website and get to the v3 download, which automatically starts. Stop the download and you'll see `Are you looking for v2 version? you can download here.` which will lead you to the v.2.51 which can connect to Streamer.bot.
