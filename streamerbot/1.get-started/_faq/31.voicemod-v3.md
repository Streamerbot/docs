description: Voicemod 3.0 is not connecting to Streamer.bot
---

Currently Voicemod 3.0 does not have an API which allows third-party applications, like Streamer.bot, to interact with it. 

## What do I do now that I installed v3 of Voicemod?
You can download v2.51 of Voicemod by going to their website and get to the v3 download, which automatically starts. Stop the download and you'll see `Are you looking for v2 version? you can download here.` which will lead you to the v.2.51 which can connect to Streamer.bot.

## Do you know when v3 will be able to connect to Streamer.bot
That is mostly up to Voicemod itself as they are working on adapting v3 to be able to work with every application that was working with v2. For more information you'd want to contact Voicemod.
