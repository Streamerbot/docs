Due to a bug introduced in version 0.2.5, **Auto Update** will not work unless you're logged into the Streamer.bot Website Integration.

To resolve this, log in via `Integrations â†’ Streamer.bot Website` in Streamer.bot, then use the top-left hamburger menu to check for updates and upgrade to the latest version.
