description: How can I exclude bots/certain users from an action like *First Words*?
---

For the most cases, this can be accomplished by an if/else-subaction (`Core -> Logic -> If/Else`). The goal is to check for the username and if it matches, break the action. So for `Input` we enter the variable `%userName%`, choose `Equals (Ignore Case)` as the `Operation` and the actual username in the `Value` field. And to make it break, we then add a `Core -> Logic -> Break` subaction into `True Result`.

You can also make use of groups (`Settings -> Groups`) and check if a user is in a group (e.g. `Twitch -> User Groups -> User In Group`) and break the action if they are.
