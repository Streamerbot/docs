description: How do I run a random subaction?
---

You can either rightclick an action and check *Random*, so a single subaction within the action is being picked randomly. Or you can create a group within the subactions, then rightclick that group and check *Random*. This will then only run a random subaction **within** the group. All the other subactions in the action outside the group will run from top to bottom as usual. (Example: [see here](<https://docs.streamer.bot/1.get-started/assets/random-group.gif>))

**Note**: Once "Random" is checked, you can rightclick the subactions and set their weight to set their probabilities.
