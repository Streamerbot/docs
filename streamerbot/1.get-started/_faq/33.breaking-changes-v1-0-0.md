description: What do I need to check after updating to 1.0.0 for the first time?
---
After updating to version 1.0.0, there are some important changes you should be aware of:

**[YouTube Send Message C#](https://docs.streamer.bot/changelogs/v1.0.0#c-changes)**:

`fallBack` parameter added, to be consistent with other platforms. Check new method format in the [changelog](https://docs.streamer.bot/changelogs/v1.0.0#c-changes).

**[Quotes](https://docs.streamer.bot/changelogs/v1.0.0#quotes)**:

In version 1.0.0, the built-in quote command "!quote" has been removed. This allows for more customization and flexibility in how quotes are retrieved and displayed.

In previous versions, the "!quote" command was directly built into Streamer.bot, meaning there was no need to create a command for it. Starting 1.0.0, the built-in command has been removed, and you will need to create your own command for it.
This is mainly to allow for more customization and flexibility in how quotes are retrieved and displayed. 

You can find an example import [here](https://docs.streamer.bot/get-started/examples/quotes-commands).

With that the "Show Quote" trigger will also not work anymore.

**[Twitch Shared Chat](https://docs.streamer.bot/changelogs/v1.0.0#twitch-shared-chat)**:

A few shared chat variables have changed/removed, and new ones have been added.

- Removed: `fromSharedChat`
- Changed: `inSharedChat` to `isInSharedChat`

**[Voicemod](https://docs.streamer.bot/changelogs/v1.0.0#voicemod)**:

The Voicemod integration now requires at least version `3.12` to be able to connect to Streamer.bot.

Voicemod Set Censor State sub-action was removed as well as the C# methods `VoiceModCensorOn()` and `VoiceModCensorOff()`.

"Soundboard Changed" trigger will not work anymore, as there is not related event coming from Voicemod anymore.
