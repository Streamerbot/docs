description: My Timed Action is not triggering at all, why's that?
---

If you have more than one platform connected to Streamer.bot (like Twitch and YouTube) while at the same time having the "Lines" requirement set to anything **other than 0** in your Timed Action, the Timed Action trigger won't ever fire. This is because Streamer.bot doesn't know which chat to monitor for the line requirement.

The dev is already aware of the issue, but there's currently no ETA for the multi-platform handling of Timed Actions.
