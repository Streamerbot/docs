description: Why are my variables like %user% or %rawInput% not parsing when using Quick Actions from the internal chat?
---

The variables for the Quick Action Bar are different from the ones in commands or rewards. It's `%displayName%` instead of `%user%` or `%message%` instead of `%rawInput%`. To see all available variables on the Quick Action Bar, see [** FAQ #6**](<https://docs.streamer.bot/get-started/faq#_6-how-do-i-know-which-variables-are-available>).
