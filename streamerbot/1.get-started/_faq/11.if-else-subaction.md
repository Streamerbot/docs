description: How do If/Else sub-actions work?
---
Since version 1.0.0 of Streamer.bot the if/else sub-action has changed to be more flexible and also allow you to run singular sub-actions in a True or False Result Group.

### Input Field
Pre-1.0.0 this field was called "Variable" as you'd directly write the variable name itself in it, like `userName`.
Now it's a general input field, so to check the value of `userName` we would write `%userName%` as using %% will give us the value of the action variable.
You can now also use Inline Functions and ~globalVar~ to check the value of a global persisted variable directly.

### Operation
This is the same as in pre-1.0.0, so basically the operation of how you want to check the value of the `Input` field, and the value of the `Value` field.
