description: Can I dock the internal chat to OBS?

No, you can't do that. The only workaround is to use the [Source Dock](<https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-dock.1317/>) OBS plugin to dock a window capture of the internal chat. This however is read-only and won't allow you to interact with it through OBS.
