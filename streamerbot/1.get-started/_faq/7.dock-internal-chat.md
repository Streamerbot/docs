description: Can I dock the internal Streamer.bot chat to OBS?
---

You can dock the internal chat in **read-only** mode by enabling the Streamer.bot WebSocket Server and adding the following URLs as Custom Browser Docks in OBS:

- Streamer.bot Chat: `https://chat.streamer.bot/feed/chat`
- Streamer.bot Event Feed: `https://chat.streamer.bot/feed/events`

With **Streamer.bot 0.2.5**, you can **interact with and send messages** via the docked chat. To enable this, go to your WebSocket Server settings (`Servers/Clients > WebSocket Server`), enable Authentication, and set a password. This password will be used to connect the docked chat.

Additionally, you can sync your quick actions and settings to the docked chat. To do this:
1. Open the main Streamer.bot chat.
2. Click the Settings menu (top-right corner).
3. Select the "Sync Settings" option at the bottom.

You will then need to confirm the sync in the docked chat window.
