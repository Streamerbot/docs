description: Can I dock the internal Streamer.bot chat to OBS?
---

Docking the internal chat is currently in beta testing and can only be accessed in the [#beta-releases](<https://discord.com/channels/834650675224248362/989593865013055648/1294689469156425880>) channel with the Beta Tester role. There is no ETA on the full release yet.


There are also OBS plugins that allow to dock external windows:
1. [Window Dock](<https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/window-dock.2005/>)
2. [Source Dock](<https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-dock.1317/>) (read only)
