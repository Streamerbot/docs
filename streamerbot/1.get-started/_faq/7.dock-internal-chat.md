description: Can I dock the internal chat to OBS?
---

This feature is currently being worked on, however there is no ETA.
Currently the only way is to use the [Source Dock](<https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-dock.1317/>) OBS plugin to dock a window capture of the internal chat. This however is read-only and won't allow you to interact with it through OBS.
