description: How can I enable actions/rewards/commands based on the current game running?

There are two options. The first one would be to trigger whenever you change your category on Twitch. You'd use the [Stream Update](<https://docs.streamer.bot/api/triggers/twitch/general/stream-update>) trigger and create an if/else-subaction (`Core -> Logic -> If/Else`) to check for:
`if %gameName% Equals GameXYZ` and put the action you want to run into the `True Result`. That action would contain all subactions to enable/disable whatever you want.

The second option is to check for when the game process starts on your PC. You'd use the [Process Started](<https://docs.streamer.bot/api/triggers/core/processes/process-started>) trigger (`Core -> Processes -> Process Started`) for that. You can then specify the name within the trigger, it usually is just the name that pops up in your [task manager](<https://docs.streamer.bot/1.get-started/assets/process-example.png>). If there are multiple process names available, try them out one by one and see which one triggers the action. Make sure process watcher is enabled in Streamer.bot's settings, too.

**Note**: Some games with anticheat will prevent you from using the process as a trigger.
