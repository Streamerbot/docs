description: What do I do if the 'import is too old' ?

## Verify the Extension
First and foremost, always verify the extension is coming from a trusted source or that you know the author prior to randomly importing things into Streamer.bot.  It would also be a really good idea to let the author know that their extension is outdated.

## Download Streamer.bot version 0.2.3
That being said, if the extension is compatible with previous versions > `0.2.0` (meaning it contains [Triggers](https://docs.streamer.bot/guide/triggers)), then you can simply download [Streamer.bot version 0.2.3](https://streamer.bot/downloads/releases/streamer.bot/0.2.3) from this link. Once downloaded (you don't even have to sign into this instance of Streamer.bot), follow the below steps.

## Steps to import older extensions
1. Press the `Import` button on your `version 0.2.3` copy of Streamer.bot
2. Drag the import file or string into the box and press `Import`
3. Highlight the newly imported `Actions` (if they're in a Group, you can Right-Click the entire Group Name)
4. After Right-Clicking on the `Actions` or Group Name, select `Add to Export`
5. Press the `Export` button in the top of your `version 0.2.3` Streamer.bot instance
6. Click `Copy to Clipboard` (when you close it out, it'll ask to clear your export, say 'Yes')
7. Navigate to your main Streamer.bot instance (`version 0.2.4+`) and press the `Import` button
8. Right-Click on the `Import String` box and press `Paste` and then `Import`
