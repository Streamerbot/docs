description: My TTS is speaking twice, why's that?

On rare occasions the UDP broadcast can cause SpeakerBot to speak twice. StreamerBot v0.2.3 introduced a websocket speak subaction (`Speaker.bot -> Speak`) that won't cause this issue. As for the UDP subaction, either disabling the second (unused) network adapter or a PC restart will fix this.
