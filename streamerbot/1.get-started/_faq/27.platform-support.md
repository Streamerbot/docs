description: Will Streamer.bot add support for Kick, TikTok, or another platform?
---
- [Kick](https://kick.com) support is **ONLY** available in version 1.0.0.
  - With version 1.0.0 Streamer.bot uses webhooks to receive events from Kick. Kick does not always send out events like Chat Messages in a timely manner, meaning there can be delays happening til something triggers in Streamer.bot.
  - Due to this requiring additional setup, at least the `Thank You` tier on Patreon will be required to use Kick. More infomation in the [Changelogs of 1.0.0](https://docs.streamer.bot/changelogs/v1.0.0#kick)
  - Once Kick introduces websocket support, for which there is an issue open regarding this on their [GitHub](https://github.com/KickEngineering/KickDevDocs/issues/20), it will be looked into to switch to that instead of webhooks.

- [TikTok](https://tiktok.com) support will be considered if/when they release a usable public API.
  - Kick API has been released, however it is currently not usable for applications like Streamer.bot, see the following 
  - TikTok API support is unknown at this time, but a Streamer.bot integration is available by [TikFinity](https://tikfinity.zerody.one/streamerbot-integration)

- Other platforms, if there is already a public API available, please let us know at [Streamer.bot Ideas & Suggestions](https://ideas.streamer.bot)
