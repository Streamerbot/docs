description: Can the bot send whispers?
---

Yes, though this can only be done with C# (`Core -> C# -> Execute C# Code`). Note that there are certain requirements and limitations when it comes to whispers: to send a whisper you need a verified phone number (so does your bot if you are sending it with the bot account), whisper limits can be seen [here](<https://docs.streamer.bot/api/triggers/twitch/chat/whispers>). You will **not** be able to see whether a whisper has been sent successfully.

This code example sends a whisper to the user who is redeeming a command:

```csharp
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {

        CPH.TryGetArg("user", out string user);
        string message = "Hello, this is a test whisper message!";
        CPH.SendWhisper(user, message, true); //set "true" to "false" if you want to send the whisper with your broadcaster account
        return true;
    }
}
```
