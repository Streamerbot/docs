description: How do I prevent my actions from overlapping/running multiple times at once?
---

1. Go into the `Action Queues` tab, then into `Queues` and create a new queue (`Rightclick -> Add`). Give it any name you like.
   
2. Check `Blocking` and click `Ok`.
   
3. Now go back into your `Actions` tab and assign the queue to all the actions you want in there by editing the action (Doubeclick the action or `Rightclick -> Edit`)

  
Done! Now the upcoming actions will only start running once the previous one has finished.

*Note: if you use OBS media sources in that action, consider putting a little delay at the end of the action so the hide transition can finish (100ms are enough if you don't use any hide transition)*
