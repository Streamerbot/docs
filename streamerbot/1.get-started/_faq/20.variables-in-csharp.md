description: How can I use variables from StreamerBot in a C# code?
---

Before using variables from triggers or subactions in a C# code, you will need to import them. The method depends on the variable type you are trying to import, see [**here**](/guide/csharp#arguments).

Example to import the `%user%` variable (string):
```csharp
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        string user = args["user"].ToString();
        return true;
    }
}
```

**Note**: If you import a variable that has not been populated, the code will break at this point. For dynamic triggers you can prevent that by giving them a default value in case they don't exist within StreamerBot:
```csharp
string user = args.ContainsKey("user") ? args["user"].ToString() : null;
```
In this example, if `%user%` doesn't exist, it will have the value `null` and the code will continue to run.
