description: How can I use variables from Streamer.bot in a C# code?

Before using variables from triggers or subactions in a C# code, you will need to import them. Version 0.2.3 introduced a new method `CPH.TryGetArg()` that is also best practice to accomplish this.

Example to import the `%user%` variable (string) and `%cumulative%` (int):
```csharp
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        CPH.TryGetArg("user", out string userVar);
        CPH.TryGetArg("cumulative", out int cumulative);
        return true;
    }
}
```
So `"user"` within the quotation marks is our argument and `userVar` is the variable name of our C# string. You can also name them the same. If the argument `user` does not exist, it will default `userVar` to `null`. Numeric values are getting defaulted to `0` and bools to `False`.
