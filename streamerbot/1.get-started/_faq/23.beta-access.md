1. Connect your Discord account to the Streamer.bot website.
2. Join the [Streamer.bot Discord](https://discord.streamer.bot) server with the same Discord account.
3. Head to the `Channels & Roles` channel, scroll to the bottom and select `Yes!` at the question "Want to have early access to beta testing releases?".
4. Go into Streamer.bot, Integrations > Streamer.bot Website, and log into your account. 
5. The only thing left would be to go to the Hamburger menu on the top left, select `Check for Updates` and change your Update channel to `beta`.

You are also able to directly download the beta via [Downloads](https://streamer.bot/downloads) if you are logged in to the website.

Please remember, Alpha and Beta releases are not stable versions so they may contain unexpected bugs. Best practice is to copy/backup your stable Streamer.bot folder somewhere. This will ensure a fast fallback method back to stable if a crashes might be happening.
