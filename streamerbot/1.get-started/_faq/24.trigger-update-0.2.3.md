description: Why are some triggers not firing as they should, after updating to 0.2.3 ?

## BEFORE YOU STREAM
Be sure to check any triggers you have set up that have criteria (like Cheers, Twitch Subs, etc.), and may overlap in some way, and configure the `Don't Run If `settings for them. This can be done by right-clicking the trigger, then `Don't Run If`.
This is unfortunately not something that can be done with a configuration upgrade, as it has no idea what triggers are supposed to activate over others.
