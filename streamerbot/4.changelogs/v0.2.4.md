::

## Details
### YouTube
The YouTube integration no longer relies on the Google libraries, that's 5 fewer DLLs being supplied with Streamer.bot moving forward. However, these DLLs will be left alone if they are already present in your Streamer.bot folder.

Also moving forward, YouTube will only need 1 main scope to function. Because of the scope mis-match, it will ask to re-authenticate when you start Streamer.bot.
#### Emotes
With **Streamer.bot** `0.2.4`, YouTube emotes are finally being parsed and sent along with message events.  This includes emotes from `YouTube` (public ones), `BetterTTV`, `SevenTV` as well as `Twemoji`.  There are 2 new arguments added to the YouTube Message event, parts and emotes. The parts contains the message as created in parts, and emotes contains a list of emotes in the message (like Twitch)
#### Ban/Timeout
Being able to Ban and/or Timeout a user in your YouTube chat is available as of `0.2.4`.
#### Multi Broadcast Support
Here is an update I've had cooking for a while. Streamer.bot now supports handling multiple YouTube broadcasts.

The YouTube sub-actions have been updated to include a Broadcast dropdown, where you can select from All, Latest and Variable.
* Using All will update all broadcasts
* Using Latest will update the latest broadcast monitored
* Using Variable uses the fixed broadcast.id variable to select the broadcast
The send message methods have been updated, and will send a message to any broadcast that is currently being monitored. Also, the sub-action has been updated with a drop down to pick a broadcast, this will let you choose all, latest, or from variable. The variable option will use a variable that is set by YouTube events that indicate which broadcast they came from, and will send the message only to that broadcast.

Once you're logged into `YouTube`, the `Broadcasts` tab will be populated with your **20** most recent broadcasts. You can right click on a broadcast, and pick `Monitor` to start monitoring it. There is also a setting under Settings, to `Auto Monitor Live Broadcasts`. `Broadcasts` will not be auto monitored unless you either explicitly set it to, or enable auto for live broadcasts. Completed broadcasts can **not** be monitored.
#### Tags
You can now modify the Tags of a broadcast.

Within the YouTube platform tab, under Settings you can add default Tags. This acts as a basic list for quickly adding/removing tags on Broadcasts that are not completed.

When you right click on a Broadcast, there is a new menu item, Tags, there will be an item Add, where you can type in a tag to add, as well as a combined list of Tags the broadcast has, and the Tags you've added to the Default Tags under settings. If a broadcast has the tag, there will be a checkmark next to it.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
This is an **expensive** call to make, and ``tags``, as a string, comma separated are limited to **500** characters.  Also, `Tags` are case sensitive.
::
#### New Sub-actions
Added the following new sub-actions for YouTube:
* Ban User
* Timeout User
#### New Triggers
Added the following new triggers for YouTube:
* `Broadcast Added`
* `Broadcast Removed`
* `Broadcast Monitoring Started`
* `Broadcast Monitoring Ended`
#### Events
It has come to my attention that certain events were not triggering, after some searching and testing, it appears that some events just flat out do not work.

The following YouTube triggers will never work until `YouTube` adds the data to the `API`.
* Message Deleted
* Message Retracted
* YouTube Polls
The last 2 do not exist as triggers yet, but wanted to make note of them.
#### Updated C# Methods
```cs
void SendYouTubeMessage(string message, bool bot = true, string broadcastId = null);
```
#### New C# Methods
```cs
void SendYouTubeMessageToAllMonitored(string message, bool bot = true);
void SendYouTubeMessageToLatestMonitored(string message, bool bot = true);
```
```cs
YouTubeBroadcastInfo YouTubeGetLatestMonitoredBroadcast();
List<YouTubeBroadcastInfo> YouTubeGetMonitoredBroadcasts();
bool YouTubeSetTitle(string title, string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeSetDescription(string description, string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeSetPrivacy(string privacy, string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeSetCategory(string categoryName, string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeSetMetaData(string title, string description, string privacy, string categoryName, string broadcastId = null);
```
`YouTubeBroadcastInfo` class
```cs
public class YouTubeBroadcastInfo
{
    public DateTime MonitoredAt { get; set; }
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string ChannelId { get; set; }
    public string LiveChatId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public string CategoryId { get; set; }
    public string CategoryName { get; set; }

    public List<string> Tags { get; set; }

    public string DefaultLanguage { get; set; }
    public string DefaultAudioLanguage { get; set; }

    public string Privacy { get; set; }

    public DateTime PublishedAt { get; set; }
    public string Status { get; set; }
}
```
```cs
bool YouTubeClearTags(string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeAddTags(List<string> tags, string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeRemoveTags(List<string> tags, string broadcastId = null);
```
```cs
bool YouTubeTimeoutUserById(string userId, int duration, string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeTimeoutUserByName(string userName, int duration, string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeBanUserById(string userId, string broadcastId = null);
bool YouTubeBanUserByName(string userName, string broadcastId = null);
```
### Updating
The upgrade code was starting to get a bit unruly, and unnecessary to keep bringing forward, so, starting with `0.2.4`, the **minimum** version supported for upgrading is `0.2.0`. The auto-updater has already been updated, so anyone below `0.2.0` will be presented with `0.2.0` as an available update, and anyone on `0.2.0` or higher, will be presented with the latest.
### Action Queue
I've applied some performance tweaks to how the Action Queue is handled within the UI.

This is now threaded and separate from the main queue threads, so what this hopefully means is, during high volume events, `Streamer.bot's` UI will not freeze like it did before. There still maybe some slowdowns, but this is due to the volume of adding/updating UI elements.
### Masked Variables
There is a new tab under `Settings` called `Variables`, here you will be able to toggle the option `Mask Variables Containing`, and add/delete keytwords to the list of keywords that will cause a variable to be masked in the `Variable Viewer`

These settings are not real time, and any changes will require the `Variable Viewer` be re-opened after making changes.
### Twitch
#### New Scopes
The following scopes are required on the broadcaster account now, these supoport the move from PubSub events to EventSub events
* user:read:emotes
* moderator:manage:unban_requests
* moderator:read:moderators
* moderator:read:vips
* moderator:read:suspicious_users
* moderator:manage:warnings
#### PubSub
It was mentioned in the last TwitchDev broadcast, that sometime in the near future PubSub would be deprecated. So starting with this alpha, I have moved a good majority of the events that rely on PubSub over to there counterparts on EventSub.

#### IMPORTANT
Take note, there are breaking changes with the update to EventSub for some events, specifically for those that rely on Streamer.bot's websocket messages.

This will affect the following events:
* Timeout
* Untimeout
* Ban
* Unban
* Clear Chat
* Moderator Add
* Moderator Remove
* VIP Add
* VIP Remove

There are 4 events still left on PubSub, and they are:
* Ad Midroll
* Viewer Count Update
* Community Goal Contribution
* Community Goal Ended

The 2 community goal events do not have an equivalent in EventSub (yet), these goals are the channel point based goals, which seem to be overlooked by Twitch.

The Ad Midroll event will likely be going away, and I will expand the new Ad event that was introduced in 0.2.3.

The Viewer Count Update event has no EventSub counterpart, so this will require other means to obtain, but may not be as accurate.
#### Auto Reward Redemptions
These rewards, are the 5 fixed ones that you can enable/disable in your channel points.

These rewards are also now being tracked in the twitch data db.

Before it's asked, no, you can not enable/disable them from SB, as there are no API endpoints to do this as of this version.
#### Sub and ReSub Triggers
Twith Sub and Resub events now have 3 new variable, `isMultiMonth`, `multiMonthDuration` and `multiMonthTenure`
#### Watch Streak
When a user publicly shares there `Watch Streak` in your channel, you can now use the `Twitch Watch Streak` trigger to react to it, and this trigger has a `Min`/`Max` criteria. In addition, when a `Watch Streak` is shared, it is saved in the `data repo` for Twitch, for future use.
#### New Sub-actions
* Reward Set Max Per Stream
* Reward Set Max Per User Per Stream
#### New C# Methods
```cs
bool TwitchApproveAutoHeldMessage(string messageId);
bool TwitchDenyAutoHeldMessage(string messageId);
```
```cs
TwitchWarnUser(string userName, string reason);
```
```cs
void UpdateRewardMaxPerStream(string rewardId, long redeems, bool additive = false);
void UpdateRewardMaxPerUserPerStream(string rewardId, long redeems, bool additive = false);
```
```cs
List<TwitchRewardCounter> TwitchGetRewardUserCounters(string rewardId, bool persisted = true);
```
```cs
bool TwitchAddBlockedTerm(string term);
bool TwitchRemoveBlockedTerm(string term);
```
### OBS
OBS handling in `0.2.4` received a little bit of TLC.

With the issues surrounding users deleting and recreating OBS connections, thus severing the link sub-actions had to the connection, I've expanded the usage of the `Default` connection for OBS.

Prior to `0.2.4`, you could mark an `OBS Connection` as `Default`, and this would be used when you `Import` actions that contain `OBS sub-actions`, it would set them to use whatever is configured as default, and I'm pretty sure most weren't aware of this, or used it.

So, starting with `0.2.4`, the `Default` connection has more meaning now.

First up, all sub-actions have a new entry you can pick in the connection drop down, `Default`, this will mean the sub-action uses whatever is configured as `Default`, this has also been applied to Triggers

Since this is an underlying change, a configuration upgrade will be performed, and the following will happen:
* OBS Connections will be moved to there own json file
* If there is only 1 connection, and it's not marked as `Default`, it will be marked as `Default`
* If there are multiple connections, and none are marked as `Default`, then the first connection in the list will be marked as `Default`
* **All** OBS Sub-actions will be updated, if there connection does not exist, or if the connection matches the `Default`, it will be changed to `Default` from the specific one
* **All** OBS Triggers will be updated, using the same criteria as sub-actions, and those with Any will be left alone

When you add and delete OBS Connections, if you remove them all, and add a new one, it will automatically be marked as `Default`. If you remove the `Default` connection, then the first connection will automatically be marked.
### Import/Export
Much like the config upgrades for **Streamer.bot**, starting with ``0.2.4``, you will **no** longer be able to import and exports from `pre-0.2.0`. While this isn't ideal, the entire import/export system was a bit fragile as not all configuration updates were being done, sometimes leading to bad data.

Also with `0.2.4`, exports will now have `default Minimum` versions, this is set by me internally. Some of this code was already in place, it was just never enforced.

One last change, is `stable` releases will be able to import exports from pre-release versions however, a warning dialog will show when importing them.

Finally, I've gone through and fixed the upgrade paths from various versions, so data across the board should be correct now.

The entire import/export system was a bit neglected in this regard, so this allowed me to finally get it fixed up.
### Elgato WaveLink
With the new version of `Elgato WaveLink`, `v1.11.1`, some of the data structures changed, which completely broke the integration. I have gone through and updated what is needed, and increased the minimum required version of `WaveLink`.

Moving forward, version `1.11.1` of `WaveLink` will be **required**.
### Elgato CameraHub
I went through and did some testing with a Facecam Mk.2, and after much hair pulling, cursing, and just general wtfs, I've updated the CameraHub integration with fixes and tweaks.
### New sub-action
* Set Sharpness
* Set Dynamic Range
### Copy/Paste
With 0.2.4, you can now copy and paste sub-action groups.  No longer do you need to copy 1 sub-action at a time, if they're grouped, you can copy the entire group.
### HypeRate.io
HypeRate added a new feature to auto clip on Twitch, and the new event is related to this, it only triggers when HypeRate itself has created a clip.

THIS IS NOT an event for whenever a Twitch Clip is created, that does not exist in Twitch's EventSub/API capabilities at the moment.
### Pally.gg
`Pally.gg` is now supported!

In order to setup `Pally.gg`, you will need an API Key from there website. You can get this from your dashboard.

#### Triggers Added
* Connected
* Disconnected
* Campaign Tip
### Fourthwall
The Fourthwall integration now supports the following new triggers:
* `Thank You Sent`
* `Newsletter Subscribed`
* `Gift Draw Started`
* `Gift Draw Ended`
A Note about `Newsletter Subscribed`, the only data sent in this event is the users **email**, so **please be careful** how this is used.
### Audio Service
With `0.2.4`, you can now **stop** all playing sounds, or a playing sound. Yes, you heard that right, you can now **stop** sounds that have been started in **Streamer.bot**

2 new sub-actions have been added:
* Stop All Sound Playback
* Stop Sound Playback
The first sub-action, `Stop All Sound Playback` does just that, it will stop any sound that has been started with the `Play Sound`, `Play Sound From Folder` or equivalent C# methods. Be sure to add this sub-action in a **different queue** then your sounds, or in in a non-blocking queue.

The `Play Sound` and `Play Sound From Folder` have received new properties, `Name`, and `Use FileName as Name`. By default, `Name` is empty, and `Use FileName as Name` is true.

The Name field can contain one of 4 values:
* Leaving it empty will use a **"default"** name
* Entering your own value into is, such as **"specialSound"**
* Using a `variable`, this field will parse the `variable`, but if it's unable to, it will be the `variable` itself
* If `Use FileName as Name` is enabled, then it will be the file name **without** the extension.

The second sub-action, `Stop Sound Playback` will let you stop a specific sound, by `name`. As outlined above, the `name` you want to use here, is what you set in the `Name` field in the `Play Sound` or `Play Sound from Folder` sub-action. This will stop all sounds that have this name.

Both of these sub-actions, if stopping a sound that you're waiting to complete, will return the duration of how long it played for.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
Any existing `Play Sound` and `Play Sound From Folder` sub-actions will default to `Use FileName as Name`, this means, if the file you are playing is `some-random-sound.mp3`, then it's name will be `some-random-sound`
::
#### New C# Methods
```cs
void StopAllSoundPlayback();
void StopSoundPlayback(string soundName);
```
Updated C# Play Sound methods
```cs
double PlaySound(string fileName, float volume = 1.0f, bool finishBeforeContinuing = false, string name = null, bool useFileName = true);
double PlaySoundFromFolder(string path, float volume = 1.0f, bool recursive = false, bool finishBeforeContinuing = false, string name = null, bool useFileName = true);
```
### VoiceMod
With the release of **Streamer.bot 0.2.4**, the `VoiceMod` integration will now require a **minimum version** of `2.51`

This requirement was put in place to simplify some of the VoiceMod code, and overall to improve it.
#### New Triggers
* Connected
* Disconnected
* Voice Loaded
* Soundboard Changed
### Commands
With this release, command counters have been moved to there own database. This allows for greater control and flexibility. Existing counters are converted over to the new database if they are persisted.

#### New C# Methods
```cs
int CommandGetCounter(string commandId);
CommandCounter CommandGetUserCounter(string userLogin, Platform platform, string commandId);
CommandCounter CommandGetUserCounterById(string userId, Platform platform, string commandId);
```
`CommandCounter` class
```cs
public class CommandCounter
{
    public string UserId { get; set; }
    public string UserLogin { get; set; }
    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Platform { get; set; }
    public int Count { get; set; }
    public int Source { get; set; }
    public DateTime LastUsed { get; set; }
}
```
```cs
void CommandResetCounter(string commandId);
void CommandResetAllUserCounters(string commandId);
void CommandResetUsersCounters(string userId, Platform platform, bool persisted);
void CommandResetUserCounter(string commandId, string userId, Platform platform);
```
### Streamer.bot Website
The interop between the website and the application got a bit of a boost with 2 new features!

Remote Triggers, and Remote Signaling

For both of these features to function, while in alpha, `0.2.4-alpha.5` is the minimum required version for `Triggers`, and `0.2.4-alpha.6` for `Signals`.

This feature **REQUIRES** both instances of **Streamer.bot** to have the `Website Integration` connected.

#### Remote Triggers
You can now send a trigger to another instance of Streamer.bot that is logged into your account.

Much like the C# activate trigger, you are able to add a **Streamer.bot** Remote Instance Trigger trigger to an action, and specify any or a specific origin instance, as well as the custom name for the event. In another copy of **Streamer.bot**, you can use the **Streamer.bot** Remote Instance Trigger sub-action, to trigger that remote trigger.

You can also see an event history on the website under your settings, with the ability to replay triggers from there.

#### Remote Signals
You are now able to wait for signals sent by other instances.

There are 2 new sub-actions added:
* Send Remote Signal
* Wait For Remote Signal

The premise behind these 2 sub-actions is a way to communicate with another remote instance of **Streamer.bot**.

#### Send Signal
This will allow you to send a named signal, with or without arguments to either all, or a specific Streamer.bot Instance

#### Wait For Signal
This sub-action will, as the name implies, wait for a named signal from any or a specific Streamer.bot instance up to a specified timeout (default 30s), consume the arguments it received, and carry on with the rest of the action.

### Run Action Sub-action
This sub-action has received a custom runtime menu item, Goto Action

### Read Random Line from File
This sub-action has been updated to include an option to Overwrite Existing Variable(s)

If this is enabled, the variables added to the action, will always start at 0, and overwrite any existing.

### Local Signals
Signals have been added for the local instance of Streamer.bot, these behave the same way as there Remote counter parts, but, are meant for local usage.

### Shortcut Keys
I've gone through and hopefully fixed shortcut key, and also added a few new ones.

#### Global Keys Available
* `F1` - Launch https://docs.streamer.bot/
* `Ctrl + S` - Save
* `Ctrl + Alt + I` - Open Import Dialog
* `Ctrl + Alt + E` - Open Export Dialog
* `Ctrl + Alt + C` - Open Chat
* `Ctrl + Alt + V` - Open Variable Viewer
* `Ctrl + L` - Open your Log Folder

Actions, Sub-Actions, Triggers, Commands, Timed Actions, MIDI In/Out, MIDI Events, and Quotes all have shortcut keys as well.
### Throwing System
This release received 2 new sub-actions
* Throw Items
* Throw Items By Name
These sub-actions will let you throw multiple items in one sub-action
### New C# Methods
Added the following C# Methods for Incrementing a global variable
```cs
void IncrementAllTwitchUsersVar(string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void IncrementTwitchUsersVarById(List<string> userIds, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
