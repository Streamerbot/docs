## Details

### Triggers
Gone are the days of having to move through multiple tabs to assign an action to an event.

Now, you assign a Trigger directly to one or more actions that act on events.

There are currently **166** different Triggers available in **Streamer.bot**, and there will probably be more!

When upgrading from **0.1.22**, all your events that you have actions associated with, will be upgraded automatically to Triggers.

As you are using triggers, much like sub-actions, you will be able to favorite the ones you use the most by right clicking on the trigger within the menu.

Want an overview of triggers used, and which actions have them.  Within the main window, above the trigger list, there is a `?`, clicking this will open the trigger viewer, where you can see a full overview of triggers in use.  **Note** This window does not update in realtime, and requires a manual refresh if changes are made while it's open.

Also at the top of the triggers list, is a `+`, this will allow you to add triggers to the selected action.

Triggers that are disabled, will be shown as red in the list, and triggers that have the `Always Run` option set, will be shown as blue

#### Behavior
This is the behaviour for triggers, when there is a mix of Any, and Range based, or other criteria based.

The behavior is as follows, for an `event`.

If a `Trigger` has a `Min/Max`, it will get all the `exact` matches, if there are none, then it will try to get the `range` matches, if there are still none, then it will get `any` matches.

If a `Trigger` is `editable`, but not a `Min/Max`, it will get a count of `Any`, and if there is a `disparity`, i.e., there is 1 Any, but say 4 with a Criteria, it will only use those with a `Criteria`

In addition to the above, you can `flag` certain Triggers to `Always Run`, this flag is only available on `editable` triggers. Once either of the two are checked, it will add any Always Run triggers, and proceed to use that list of Triggers

If neither of the two above are met, then it will just run all the triggers for the event.

#### Custom Triggers
Not only are there Triggers for fixed events within **Streamer.bot**, but you'll also be able to create your own named triggers within the UI as will as in C#.  Both of which can be triggered within C#.

If you use the Custom trigger within the UI, just enter any name, and you can trigger it within C# using the following:
```cs
// the name, useArgs is a boolean that if true, will forward the args of the action to the trigger
CPH.TriggerEvent("whatever you named it in the UI");
```
To register a custom trigger in C#, that will show up in the Custom menu, use the following:
```cs
// Name, event name, and categories it sits in
CPH.RegisterCustomTrigger("Something", "mine_something", new[] { "Stuff" });
```
And to trigger it within your code:
```cs
CPH.TriggerCodeEvent("mine_something");
```
Typically you would register a trigger in the `void Init()`method, and have it compile at start

#### New Triggers
There are a couple new Triggers, that previously did not exist as events within **Streamer.bot**

###### Process Started
Trigger an action when a process has started on your PC

###### Process Stopped
Trigger an action when a process has stopped on your PC

#### Other New Triggers
A general list of new events that are available through triggers

* OBS Scene Changed
* YouTube New Subscriber (handled via StreamElements)
* OBS Streaming Started
* OBS Streaming Stopped
* OBS Recording Started
* OBS Recording Stopped
{.grid-list}

### VTube Studio
A brand new integration is coming to **v0.2.0**, and that's VTube Studio!

You'll be able to react to some events from VTube Studio, as well as 5 new sub-actions to interact with it.

There are also a handful of C# methods, for those that prefer to write C# code for there actions.

#### New Sub-actions
The following sub-actions are available for use with VTube Studio
* Load Model
* Load Model by Name
* Trigger Hotkey
* Trigger Hotkey by Name
* Move Model
* Color Tint
* Remove All Color Tints
* Set Expression State
{.grid-list}

#### New C# Methods for VTubeStudio
```cs
bool VTubeStudioLoadModelById(string modelId);
bool VTubeStudioLoadModelByName(string modelName);
bool VTubeStudioTriggerHotkeyById(string hotkeyId);
bool VTubeStudioTriggerHotkeyByName(string hotkeyName);
bool VTubeStudioMoveModel(double seconds, bool relative, double? posX = null, double? posY = null, double? rotation = null, double? size = null);
bool VTubeStudioRandomColorTint();
bool VTubeStudioResetAllColorTints();
bool VTubeStudioColorTintAll(string hexColor, double mixWithSceneLighting = 0);
bool VTubeStudioColorTintByNumber(string hexColor, double mixWithSceneLighting, List<int> artMeshNumbers);

bool VTubeStudioColorTintByNameContains(string hexColor, double mixWithSceneLighting, List<string> filterValues);
bool VTubeStudioColorTintByTags(string hexColor, double mixWithSceneLighting, List<string> filterValues);
bool VTubeStudioColorTintByTagContains(string hexColor, double mixWithSceneLighting, List<string> filterValues);
bool VTubeStudioActivateExpression(string expressionFile);
bool VTubeStudioDeactivateExpression(string expressionFile);
VTSModelPosition VTubeStudioGetModelPosition();
string VTubeStudioSendRawRequest(string requestType, string data);
```
```cs
public class VTSModelPosition
{
	public double PositionX { get; set; }
	public double PositionY { get; set; }
	public double Rotation { get; set; }
	public double Size { get; set; }
}
```

### CrowdControl 2.0
Yes, that's right, yet another integration, and this time it's CrowdControl 2.0!

With this integration, you can now react to 8 different events from CrowdControl.

Since CrowdControl themselves are still developing this version, there are things within **Streamer.bot** that can change as well, and new features are still pending.

### Elgato Wave Link

#### New C# Methods
In addition to new sub-actions and trigger, there are also a handful (24 to be exact) new C# methods for interacting with Elgato Wave Link
```cs
void WaveLinkOutputMute(string mixer);
void WaveLinkOutputUnmute(string mixer);
void WaveLinkOutputToggleMute(string mixer);
void WaveLinkSetOutputVolume(string mixer, int volume);

bool WaveLinkInputGetFilterState(string inputIdentifier, string filterIdentifier);
```

### YouTube Bot Account
Yes, I've heard you, and I was finally able to figure out the best way to handle this.

Starting with **0.2.0** you can setup a bot account for YouTube, and use this as the mouth piece for talking to chat.  The YouTube send message sub-action has been udpated, as well as the C# methods.

### Import/Export
How you export actions and command has changed with **0.2.0**, no longer do you havhe to scroll through a list to select the actions you want.  Now, you can just right click on an action, and use the `Add to Export` or `Remove from Export` menu items.  Best of all, the Export window is no longer modal, which means you can keep it open off to the side, as you add your actions and commands and see it populate.  THere is also new information you can attach to an export, such as author, description and a version.

The Import window has also changed to accomodate the new data that's available with exports from **0.2.0**, but don't worry, it will still accept imports from older versions.

Importing will also properly handle new triggers, as well as updating certain data in old exports to the new trigger system.

New with the Import system, you'll be able to overwrite commands and actions, this is primarily for exports from **0.2.0**, as legacy exports altered ids, so matching them correctly is not possible. When you're presented with actions and commands to import, you can right click on an action  or a command, and include/exclude it, if its an exact match to an existing action or command, you can also flag it to be overwritten or not.

### Global Variables Viewer
Ever wonder what global variables are floating around **Streamer.bot**? will, now you can see them, and see them update in realtime with a Global Variable viewer.

In addition to seeing them, you can add new ones, edit existing ones, and even outright delete them.

### Inline Chat Window
Open up a window, and view your Twitch, and/or YouTube chat, right within **Streamer.bot** itself!

### Inline Global Accessor
You can now use `~` to access global variables directly. They will be replaced with the global variable value, if it exists at the time of parsing.

bool UpdateRewardBackgroundColor(string rewardId, string backgroundColor);

	"eventName": "<registered name of event>",
	"args": {
		"id": "<someid>"
	}
}
```
