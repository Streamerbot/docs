## Details
### Websocket Events
#### ActionCompleted
`0.1.17` introduces a new Raw event, ActionCompleted.  Subscribing to this event in the Websocket Server will get you information when an action is completed.

### New Sub-Actions
#### Twitch Add, Remove, Clear and Set Channel Tags
Yes, Twitch finally added the ability to manipulate the new tags!

The Clear Channel Tags sub-action has no input, and will just clear your tags.

The Add, Remove and Set Channel Tag sub-actions all support variables.

The Add Target Info adds the following new arguments:

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`tagCount` | The number of tags
`tag#` | The tag at index position #
`tags` | A `List<string>()` object for use in C#
`tagsDelimited` | A comma delimited string of the tags

> At the moment, there is a bug in the Twitch Helix endpoint, where its unable to clear the tags completely.  So for the time being Clear Tags and Removing the last tag will fail. Once Twitch fixes this, they should start working.
>
> If you keep at least 1 tag active, you'll be able to add/remove tags at will.  And for setting all tags, at least 1 needs to be set.

#### Twitch Send Shoutout
This is a basic sub-action, either use a variable, or a fixed user login to send a shoutout to the user.

> You may send a Shoutout once every 2 minutes, and to the same broadcaster once every 60 minutes.

#### Clear Users From a Group
This sub-action will allow you to select one of your groups, so you can clear the users belonging to it during an action

#### Twitch Start and Cancel Raid
Since the C# methods for this have existed for a bit, adding in sub-actions to perform this now as well.

### Updated Events
#### Twitch Shoutout Created
With the Shoutout events being added to EventSub, this event has been moved from PubSub to EventSub, this unfortunately changes some of the variables.  This Event has also been moved to the `Moderation` tab

Variables Removed
* `%targetUserPrimaryColorHex%`
* `%targetUserProfileImageURL%`

Variables Added

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`viewerCount` | The number of users that were watching the broadcasterâ€™s stream at the time of the Shoutout.
