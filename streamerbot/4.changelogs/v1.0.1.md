## Details
### VoiceMod
Since quite a few would rather use VoiceMod v2 instead of v3 for various reasons, I have brought back support for VoiceMod 2.48 to 2.51, as well as VoiceMod 3.12+

The `Set Censor State` sub-action has returned, but do take note, this only works for VoiceMod v2
### New Sub-Actions
This release introduces **2** new sub-actions, `File Exists` and `Folder Exists`. You can use either of these sub-actions to determine if a file or folder exists, supports parsing, and your own variable to put the result in.
### Kick
Aside from the occasional service slowdown from `Kick`, the integration seems to be working well.  However, we have noticed that the number of connections has plateaued a bit, and after some investigation, it appears as tho `Kick` has a **limit** on Webhook subscriptions and you need to contact them to get this limit raised, which we have done and are just waiting to hear back from them now.

The day **1.0.0** released, Kick added reply to data to chat messages.  WIth **1.0.1** this data is now available in the Kick Message event and Websocket payload data.
### Hot Keys
When upgrading from `0.2.x` to `1.0` Hot Keys were converted to the new format of the `Key Press` trigger.  Unfortunately, during the alpha it was missed that this is not a straight conversion and required a conversion table to correctly convert some of the keys.

With version `1.0.1`, this conversion is done correctly.  So, if you were sitting on `0.2.8` and waiting, upgrading to `1.0.1` will correctly convert your `Hot Keys`. This change cannot be applied to those who have already updated to `1.0.0`, because it was not every key and there were overlaps.
### Actions
When upgrading from `0.2.x` to `1.0.0`, `Actions` were converted to the new nestable format, during this change there was a bug when dealing with sub-actions that were in a group that was missed during the alpha/beta cycles, which would cause sub-actions to be out of order.  This happened with imports as well.

With version `1.0.1` this has been fixed, and the conversion works as it should and retains ordering of the sub-actions.  If you have been holding off on upgrading because of this bug, you should be able to upgrade now, and as always, backup and run a test to double check.

This fix is not something that can be done retroactively and requires updating from `0.2.x` to `1.0.1` to upgrade correctly.  Or, creating an export in `0.2.x` and importing into `1.0.1`.
### Notes
I wanted to thank everyone who has upgrade and all the positive feedback so far.
