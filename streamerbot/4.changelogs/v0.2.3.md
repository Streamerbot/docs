## Details
### YouTube Quota
A quick update here, unfortunately it seems like every day the quota is being exhausted. Usually 3-4 hours prior to reset, or less.

The application to get more quota was submitted already, and it's currently just a waiting game. I'm hoping this is resolved soon, and Google gives me more quota.

### Simulated Events
Prior to **0.2.0**, one could test certain Twitch events from within the respective events tabs, and with the release of **0.2.0**, this was change to be able to test the `Triggers` directly.

With the addition of `Triggers`, this opened up the ability to have multiple actions triggered by the same event, so in order to test this, you would have to goto each action, and test the trigger manually.

With **0.2.3**, a new way of testing has been added, `Simulated Events`

`Simulated Events` are still initiated from a trigger's context menu, however, they will allow you to specify certain data (for instance, for a cheer, you pick the user, and specify the amount), and it will simulate this event application wide, so any triggers that match, will be run.

With this feature, also comes a way to not only search your local user cache, but, to also search against Twitch itself.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
The API used for searching only returns users who have streamed within the last 6 months, this is a limitation of the API, and is not possible to circumvent
::

### User Changes
This change has been a long time coming, especially after the introduction of 2 new platforms (Trovo and VStream).

Configuration updates will happen to users, groups, and commands, and anything that uses a user id in a global sense (i.e., it supports users from multiple platforms)

Overall, this enables a better internal tracking of users, while maintaining a platform's specific user id for the users themselves.

### Trigger Update
So, way back when, `0.2.2-alpha.6` to be exact, a fix was put in dealing with Min/Max logic . This fix, while it worked for what was needed, cause another bug, which unfortunately went unnoticed, and wound up being included in `0.2.2` that went to stable.

#### The Issue
Lets say you have 2 actions, both of which have a `Twitch ReSub` trigger on them. One of the triggers is configured for `Any Tier` and `Any Cumulative`, the other is configured for `Tier 1` and `Any Cumulative`.

What will happen with this scenario, is, when a `Tier 1` resub happens, it will see that there are 2 triggers that could be used, but, since the `Twitch ReSub` has a `Min/Max` component, it goes on to further checks, and within these checks, it basically rules out the specific `Tier 1` trigger, and leaves the `Any` trigger to be run.

Now, ofc, what's suppose to happen, is the `Tier 1` specific trigger is suppose to run, and if you had Always Run Trigger enabled on the Any trigger, that should run as well.

#### The Fix
This is more of an evolution of the `Trigger` system, but, at the same time is a fix.

The secondary check mentioned above, no longer happens, instead, this happens:

Within the UI, when you right click on a trigger, there will be a new menu item, `Don't Run If`, and within this menu item, will be listed the action and criteria of the trigger of any of the same trigger types.

If a trigger has been marked as `Don't Run If` in another trigger, then it will not show up in the target trigger, this is a sanity check, otherwise a stalemate will happen and neither would run.

Example is as follows:

You have 3 actions, `Cheer 1`, `Cheer 2`, `Cheer 3`. Each of these actions has a `Twitch Cheer` trigger set to `1-100`, `1-100` and `Exact 50` respectively.
The `1-100` trigger in `Cheer 2`, has `Cheer 3 - Exact: 50` in it's `Don't Run If` menu item checked.

When you simulate a cheer for 50, the action history will show `Cheer 1`, and `Cheer 3` as having run. This is because, `Cheer 2's 1-100 Cheer` trigger, is configured to not run if `Cheer 3's Exact:50` trigger runs.

#### Before You Stream
After updating to this alpha, **BEFORE YOU STREAM**, be sure to check any triggers you have setup that have criteria, and may overlap in some way, and configure the `Don't Run If` settings for them.

This is unfortunately not something that can be done with a configuration upgrade, as, it has no idea what triggers are suppose to activate over others.

### Twitch
For some unknown reason, fetching the Broadcaster's banned user list can trigger a rate limit, this is fairly inconsistent, and I'm not really sure why, so this is now handled as it was crashing the login proccess for the Broadcaster account.

With the change to API for sending Twitch Chat messages, at the moment there is no distinction if its internal or not anymore, its treated as a normal message. I will be looking into ways to handle this in a future release.

#### Poll Sub-actions
I know it's been a long time coming, but there is now a new sub-action to create a Twitch Poll, and all fields in this sub-action support argument parsing.

#### New Sub-actions
* Poll Create
* Poll Terminate
* Poll Archive

#### New Triggers
* Emote on/off
* Subscriber on/off
* Unique Mode on/off
* Moderator Added/Removed
* VIP Added

#### New Twitch Scopes
The following new scopes are being requested on your Twitch Broadcaster account:
* channel:manage:ads
* channel:read:ads
* user:read:chat
* user:write:chat

#### Twitch Upcoming Ad
A new addition to this release is the handling of upcoming ads. With the addition of the ad schedule endpoint, Streamer.bot can now know when your next ad is coming up.

During various stages/events, a check is performed to see when the next ad is scheduled for. If it is, this will start an internal timer that is on a 30s tick, and will continusouly monitor this, and at the 5 minute prior mark, will send a `TwitchUpcomingAd` trigger, and will continue to do so at the 4, 3, 2 and 1 minute mark. After which, it hopefully resets itself and 

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
This requires you to be using Twitch's built in Ad Manager to schedule your ads.
::

### StreamElements
The UI for StreamElements has been updated to have the split style with logging into your account, and sub-service connections. All the underlying code has also been updated to support this new common display.

### alejo.io Pronouns
With the release of alpha.19, VRFlad's extension for using alejo.io pronouns is no longer needed, as it is now a part of Streamer.bot itself.

This is the first iteration of this integration, so its not at parity with the extension yet.

Only 1 sub-action as been added so far, Add Pronouns for User, which will add a user's pronouns to the arguments.

### Startup Performance Improvements
Yes, that's right, found a few more areas that were behaving a bit slow during startup, and handled them better.

This mainly affected users with a long list of actions and/or commands.

### Trovo
After quite a while, Streamer.bot is being extended to support another platform, and this time it's Trovo

### First Words
First Words has been update to use a LiteDB now, instead of the previous caching method used. This capability is now platform independent.

The setting for first words auto reset is now platform independent, and this value only comes into effect during a startup of **Streamer.bot**

Each platforms `Reset` button, will only reset first words for that platform.

The C# method, sub-action, and http method to reset first words have been updated, and when these are used, they will reset the first words for **all** platforms.

### Execute C# Code
With this update, any references that are either in **Streamer.bot's** execution path, or any subfolder will be stored as a relative reference.

For example, if you're referencing `Semver.dll`, it will be stored as a relative reference of `.\Semver.dll` instead of the full path.

Any references outside of **Streamer.bot's** execution path, will still be stored as the full path.

### Speaker.bot Integration
It's been asked for, for a while, but here is the start of a more direct integration with Speaker.bot.

The new sub-action that was added, has 3 ways it can work.

1. How you're use to with the UDP in a fire and forget fashion
2. Silent option, when selected, this will only process the speech, and, if the setting is enabled in Speaker.bot, write the audio to a file, and will add a `%speechFile%` argument so you can pass it to a Play Sound sub-action, or other
3. Delay option, the most requested feature, yes, this will delay the sub-action from continuing until the audio has been played by Speaker.bot

Using either the Silent or Delay option also introduces a timeout of 30 seconds, so it does not get stuck, in a future version, this may be configurable (within reason)

There are new sub-actions for interacting with **Speaker.bot** as well
* Set Enabled State
* Set Paused State
* Stop Speaking
* Clear Pending

**NOTE** This integration requires **Speaker.bot v0.1.3**

### File Tail Service
With alpha.9, you can now tail a file. Once you have configured a file to tail, every time a new line is encountered, it will the File Tail Changed trigger to happen.

This trigger has the potential to be a high volume trigger, so be sure to exclude from the action history if it is going to be a lot of activity.

### Fourthwall
New to this alpha is Fourthwall integration. This requires configuring via the website. So go to https://streamer.bot/, and log in to your account, then go to settings, and you should see Fourthwall on the left with the information required to configure the webhooks.

Be sure that the Streamer.bot Website integration is also logged in and connected.

All event types are supported.

### VTubeStudio
The 2 new triggers, `Item Event`, and `Model Clicked` currently just relay information from the event. A future update will allow for filtering data from these events.

#### New Triggers
* ItemEvent
* ModelClicked

### Twitch Integrated Throwing System
Guess I'm on a roll, or feeling generous. With this alpha, T.I.T.S. is fully integrated in Streamer.bot.

Since there are 2 services that require a connection, when you go to the integration tab, you will notice a Websocket, and an Events service. The later needs to be connected to be able to receive events from T.I.T.S.

There is at least one more Sub-action in the works, being able to throw multiple items.

#### New Sub-actions
* Activate Trigger
* Activate Trigger by Name
* Throw Item
* Throw Item by Name

#### New Triggers
* Connected
* Websocket Connected
* Websocket Disconnected
* Events Connected
* Events Disconnected
* Item Hit
* Trigger Activated
* Trigger Ended

### Updates to Import/Export
The Importing/Exporting of Actions and Commands has grown! You can now also import/export timed actions, and custom websocket servers and clients.

The other change, for flagging an action to Auto Run on import. When a user performs an import, and an action has been configured to auto run, the user will be prompted if they want it to run, only if they agree will it be triggered.

### Headless Mode
You read that right, you can now run Streamer.bot headless, as in no GUI, only a log file.

Consider this mode very very experimental, since there is no GUI initialization anymore, any actions/sub-actions that rely on UI elements will likely crash, I still need to go through and handle these.

To run Streamer.bot in headless mode, just add `/headless`, and to stop it, add `/shutdown` when running it.
`Streamer.bot.exe /headless`
`Streamer.bot.exe /shutdown`

### websocket-sharp Update
This is rather important information. With this release, I've updated this library, and I'm now compiling it myself, since its missing a feature that won't be added (for whatever reason). This library can of course be used in your custom C# code, and if you already are, depending on what you're using, it may no longer work due to some changes to the library from upstream.

The first change is with `AddWebSocketService`, if you were using the initializer, this has changed.
The second change is for `IWebSocketSession`, there is no longer a Context property, you can now access the Websocket directly.

### C# Method Deprecation
The following methods are deprecated, and no longer do anything
```cs
void CommandResetUserCooldown(string id, int userId);
void CommandRemoveUserCooldown(string id, int userId);
void CommandAddToUserCooldown(string id, int userId, int seconds);
```
The following C# methods have been deprecated since `0.2.0`, and starting with `0.2.3`, they no longer function
```cs
T GetUserVar<T>(string userName, string varName, bool persisted = true);
void SetUserVar(string userName, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
```
These **5** methods will be removed in a future version.

### New C# Methods
Added the following new C# methods
```cs
List<GlobalVariableValue> GetGlobalVarValues(bool persisted = true);

bool TryGatArg(string argName, out object value);
bool TryGetArg<T>(string argName, out T value);
