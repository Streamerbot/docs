title: Streamer.bot v1.0.0
description: Next Major Version!
version: 1.0.0
releaseDate: null
badge: Beta
---

Welcome to **Streamer.bot 1.0 BETA!**  Yes, you read that right! **Streamer.bot 1.0** is now available for those with the beta role.

Be sure to read my latest letter to the community before diving headfirst into this update. Come see what **Streamer.bot 1.0** BETA has to offer!
# What’s New?
## Dark Mode
Let’s start with one of the most anticipated features: Dark Mode.  **Streamer.bot 1.0** received a complete redesign of its UI, along with Dark Mode. For those that still wish to have a Light Mode, there is an option to switch.
## Kick Integration
Probably the second most requested feature is Kick Integration.  I’m happy to announce that **Streamer.bot 1.0** now supports Kick natively.  At first, during the alpha when this was announced, it was planned that access to Kick integration would be a supporter perk because it needed a connection to the website to work. However, since my letter to the community in July,  the support has been very positive, so I have decided to make the Kick integration free for use.  Yes, you read that right! I’ve removed the supporter perk requirement for Kick, and anyone can use it for free.
## Cloud Backups
Streamer.bot has always created its own backups every time it is started, but with **1.0** as a supporter perk, users will be able to create and upload backups to **Streamer.bot’s** servers which can be recovered at any time.
## Custom Webhooks
Streamer.bot currently supports 4 services through webhooks: Patreon, Kofi, Fourthwall, and Shopify.  Since Webhooks require an intermediary site with full SSL capabilities typically, `Custom Webhooks` are being introduced as a supporter perk.  These will allow users to create their own webhooks to (almost) any site that supports them.
Note: There will be a few sites that will be outright denied from creating webhooks for, largely for volume reasons, and this will be monitored for abuse.
## Decks 2.0
Already released, and available for everyone to use, **Streamer.bot’s** decks have gotten a massive overhaul thanks to the ongoing efforts of Whistickgostop.  Decks will remain mostly free; however, supporter perks will raise some of the free limits on them.
## Other Notable Changes
* Nestable sub-action groups
* Updates to Logic If/Else sub-action – sub-action can be directly added to them
* New Logic sub-actions – Switch and While
* C# Code editor now uses Monaco
* HotKeys are now triggers and support any key combination
* Support for YouTube’s new PushAPI (near real-time chat and more efficient quota usage)
* The ability to host your own files from the integrated HTTP Server
* ... and so much more!
This is just a taste of the major updates that are available in Streamer.bot 1.0, so be sure to also check the changelog available on the website to get a more detailed breakdown of the fixes, changes, and additions that come with 1.0.

To access your supporter perks, login to Patreon in your Streamer.bot Account Settings.  Moving forward, all roles related to supporter perks and alpha access will be handled this way.

If you wish to support me, or this project, please head over to <https://www.patreon.com/nate1280>. Remember, supporter perks start at the Thank You tier, which for the duration of the beta is only **$2** a month with the option to support for a year.  Once **Streamer.bot 1.0** is released as stable, this will increase to **$3**.

## How to Update
I know you’re probably asking but how do I update?!  Well, this is quite easy, and here is a simple step by step list to get you updated:
1.	Have the beta role in Discord, and login to the website to link your account.
2.	Close your copy of **Streamer.bot 0.2.8**.
3.	**Duplicate** your **Streamer.bot 0.2.8** folder, either by copy pasting, dragging, etc.
4.	Re-launch **Streamer.bot 0.2.8**.
5.	Go to the Integrations, **Streamer.bot** Website tab and login.
6.	In **Streamer.bot** click the top left menu, then Check for Updates
7.	Pick the beta release channel.
8.	Click Download & Install and patiently wait while **Streamer.bot** updates itself to 1.0
9.	Enjoy **Streamer.bot 1.0!**  It’s been a year in the making.

## How to Connect to Kick
Due to the way **Kick** is setup, you will need to not only login to **Kick** within **Streamer.bot**, you will need to also login to the **Streamer.bot** Website and link your Kick account there.

After this, you will be able to connect to the client.  It requires you to be logged into **Streamer.bot** (bottom-left corner of your **Streamer.bot** window). If you are already logged in, go to the Kick platform, and make sure the Chat Client is connected.

## Details
Surprise!  This has been many months in the making, but there is finally a new UI in town, and it's been completely re-written in WPF.  This means I'll have so much more flexibility.  In addition to that, there is now a `Dark Mode`, the most requested feature.

Now for the bad news, I have not tested this, so  I'm not sure how this will effect extensions that use custom designed WinForms dialogs for settings and such.  The conversion to WPF is quite simple, and I will likely post a small template at some point to get you started.

Now, this is an alpha, this means there **will** be bugs, that is the whole point of it entering this stage first.  If you wish to use this as your daily driver, be aware, things may or may not function correctly.

Want access to `alpha`, subscribe to [nate1280's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/nate1280).  `alpha` access now starts at `Bronze Tier` or higher.
### Sub-Actions
Sub-actions got a bit of an overhaul as well, before, groups could only be top level items, now, they can be nested as much as you want, more flexibility when using the random option on a group now.
#### Logic If/Else
Logic If/Else has received a power-up, no longer do you need to specify an action to run for the true/false parts, you can now just add your sub-actions directly to the true/false groups, and because these are containers, that means you can nest groups as well.
#### Logic Switch
New with this release is a new Logic sub-action, the Switch Case.  Same applies to this sub-action, add your logic switch, and you can add case groups, which can in turn have sub-actions nested in them
#### Logic While
New with this release is the `Logic While` sub-action.  Yes, that means you can finally perform loops within a single action without needing C#!
### Global (Set) Sub-Action Changes
The `Argument` source has been removed, and there is now only `Value`, `Increment` and `Decrement`.

The `Value` source now supports **parsing and inline methods** as well as an **auto-type** option. `Increment` and `Decrement` have been updated to support parsing and inline methods.

Configuration upgrades will happen and update any `Global (Set)` sub-actions, this will change any that are set to `Argument` and update the value to be surrounded by **%**, and change it to `Value` source type. Upgrades will also happen for `Imports`.
### Inline Function,
A new function has been added, `$parse()$`, that will allow for a 2nd level of variable parsing.

This would be of benefit for the newly added `Logic While` sub-action.

As an example, ff you are using the global `~idx~` as your test variable, and incrementing this within the while loop.  You would then be able to use the inline method like `$parse(rawInput~idx~)$` which would internally parse to `%rawInput#%`, and finally would return the value of the `%rawInput#%` argument. In this example, `rawInput` is the argument you're wanting to get an indexed position of, this is typically used in most `Message` based triggers
### Twitch
Twitch PubSub is being deprecated in April, so that means it's finally time to remove PubSub from the connection list for the Broadcaster Account.

What this means, the Ad Mid Roll sub-action no longer exists (to this day, still really don't know what it did), Channel Point Community Goals will cease to work until they're added to EventSub, and the Viewer count pulse has been updated to use other methods.
### Twitch Shared Chat
Handling of `Twitch Shared Chat` has been updated a bit, there are now **3** arguments added to most `Twitch` events.
* `isInSharedChat` - This will indicate if the event happened while in a Shared Chat,
* `isSharedChatHost` - This will indicate if the Broadcaster is the host of the Shared Chat,
* `isFromSharedChatGuest` - This will indicate if the event is from a Shared Chat's Guest's Channel,
These 3 arguments are in all Shared Chat events, as well as the non-shared chat event counter parts.
### Quotes
Quotes got a small overhaul, the built in `!quote` command is no more, it has been replaced with various sub-actions, so you now have full control over adding, deleting quotes by any means.
### HTTP Server
You read that right, you can now serve **local files** with the `HTTP Server`! Simply add a `Path Mapping` to the `HTTP Server` settings, and you can access any file/folder from that `Mapping`.

The current methods are being moved to an `/api/` prefix, and they will continue to work for now but consider them deprecated, and will eventually be removed.  Be sure to update any usages to use the `/api/` equivalent.
### Voicemod
The `Voicemod` integration has been udpated to support `v3`, and version `3.12` is now the **minimum required** version for the integration.

With the update, the `Voicemod Set Censor State` sub-action was removed, as well as 2 C# methods, `VoiceModCensorOn()` and `VoiceModCensorOff()`, as the methods for these no longer work.
## Kick Platform
Yes, you read that right, as of `alpha.37`, **Streamer.bot** now supports `Kick` as an official platform.  Be sure to read the previous information in alpha-releases or announcements.

Overall the `Kick API` is still a bit of a mess, and everything that can be implemented has been.  And as mentioned, to use this platform integration, you **must** link your Kick account on the website as well!

There are new sub-actions and triggers for Kick, support for `Kick Message` as a Command source, `Kick` will show up in the chat as well as obs overlay chat.
### How To Link Kick
Due to the way `Kick` is setup, you will need to not only login to Kick within Streamer.bot, you will also need to login to the `Streamer.bot Website`, and link your `Kick` account there to.

After this, you will be able to connect to the client.  It requires you to be logged into `Streamer.bot`, bottom-left corner of your `Streamer.bot` window.
## Cloud Backup
You will be able to manually create backups that are encrypted and uploaded to *Streamer.bot's** website, as well as being able to restore from these backups.
## Custom Webhooks
You will be able to create custom webhooks, and have the data forwarded to your **Streamer.bot**, much like the existing webhooks, except they can be used for any site that supports webhooks.  This feature will be monitored for abuse and limits put in place if anything like this is detected
## Decks 2.0
They've been teased for a while, but `Decks 2.0` are also here!  This includes a handful of sub-actions to interact with the decks themselves, much like `Elgato Stream Deck`

There are also **6** new sub-actions allowing you to set various properties/values of deck buttons.

## New Website
Whipstickgostop has been hard at work, and there is a new website that launched alongside this update, both as a refresh and to support all the new features.
### C# Changes
