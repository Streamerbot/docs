## Details
Surprise!  This has been 3 months in the making, but there is finally a new UI in town, and it's been completely re-written in WPF.  This means I'll have so much more flexibility.  In addition to that, there is now a `Dark Mode`, the most requested feature.

Now for the bad news, I have not tested this, so  I'm not sure how this will effect extensions that use custom designed WinForms dialogs for settings and such.  The conversion to WPF is quite simple, and I will likely post a small template at some point to get you started.

Now, this is an alpha, this means there **will** be bugs, that is the whole point of it entering this stage first.  If you wish to use this as your daily driver, be aware, things may or may not function correctly.

### Sub-Actions
Sub-actions got a bit of an overhaul as well, before, groups could only be top level items, now, they can be nested as much as you want, more flexibility when using the random option on a group now.
#### Logic If/Else
Logic If/Else has received a power-up, no longer do you need to specify an action to run for the true/false parts, you can now just add your sub-actions directly to the true/false groups, and because these are containers, that means you can nest groups as well.
#### Logic Switch
New with this release is a new Logic sub-action, the Switch Case.  Same applies to this sub-action, add your logic switch, and you can add case groups, which can in turn have sub-actions nested in them
#### Logic While
New with this release is the `Logic While` sub-action.  Yes, that means you can finally perform loops within a single action without needing C#!
### Inline Function,
A new function has been added, `$parse()$`, that will allow for a 2nd level of variable parsing.

This would be of benefit for the newly added `Logic While` sub-action.

As an example, ff you are using the global `~idx~` as your test variable, and incrementing this within the while loop.  You would then be able to use the inline method like `$parse(rawInput~idx~)$` which would internally parse to `%rawInput#%`, and finally would return the value of the `%rawInput#%` argument. In this example, `rawInput` is the argument you're wanting to get an indexed position of, this is typically used in most `Message` based triggers
### Twitch
Twitch PubSub is being deprecated in April, so that means it's finally time to remove PubSub from the connection list for the Broadcaster Account.

What this means, the Ad Mid Roll sub-action no longer exists (to this day, still really don't know what it did), Channel Point Community Goals will cease to work until they're added to EventSub, and the Viewer count pulse has been updated to use other methods.
### Twitch Shared Chat
Handling of `Twitch Shared Chat` has been updated a bit, there are now **3** arguments added to most `Twitch` events.
* `isInSharedChat` - This will indicate if the event happened while in a Shared Chat,
* `isSharedChatHost` - This will indicate if the Broadcaster is the host of the Shared Chat,
* `isFromSharedChatGuest` - This will indicate if the event is from a Shared Chat's Guest's Channel,
These 3 arguments are in all Shared Chat events, as well as the non-shared chat event counter parts.
### Quotes
Quotes got a small overhaul, the built in `!quote` command is no more, it has been replaced with various sub-actions, so you now have full control over adding, deleting quotes by any means.
### HTTP Server
You read that right, you can now serve **local files** with the `HTTP Server`! Simply add a `Path Mapping` to the `HTTP Server` settings, and you can access any file/folder from that `Mapping`.

The current methods are being moved to an `/api/` prefix, and they will continue to work for now but consider them deprecated, and will eventually be removed.  Be sure to update any usages to use the `/api/` equivalent.
### Voicemod
The `Voicemod` integration has been udpated to support `v3`, and version `3.12` is now the **minimum required** version for the integration.

With the update, the `Voicemod Set Censor State` sub-action was removed, as well as 2 C# methods, `VoiceModCensorOn()` and `VoiceModCensorOff()`, as the methods for these no longer work.
### C# Changes
The following C# methods have been updated to account for the new `useBot` and `fallback` options.
```cs
void SendYouTubeMessage(string message, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true, string broadcastId = null);
void SendYouTubeMessageToLatestMonitored(string message,bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
void SendTrovoMessage(string message, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
```
