## Fixes
::changelog-list{type=fix}
*  Typos
*  Regression in Perform Command, variables were not being parsed
*  Better handling of OBS events, and issues surrounding editing
*  Better handling of OBS/SLOBS sub-actions where a scene is empty, signifying the source exists in any scene
*  Anonymous cheers could cause a crash with credits
*  Some underlying issues with Streamlabs/Streamelements sockets
*  Add error handling when importing actions, should no longer crash in the event something is malformed
*  Handle WASAPI init errors on playback, specifically if its unable to initialize the device
*  Some additional error handling in websocket server/client dialogs
*  Rare scenario where fetching mod/vip lists internally could cause a crash
*  Handle data issues with SLOBS not adhering to its on JSON structures
*  Grouping in OBS Events was not being handled properly (typo)
*  Custom WebsocketServer message event was emitting the wrong type of event internally
*  GetCredits method was putting Hype Train conductors in the wrong field
*  Twitch Slow mode sub-action was not being deserialized properly
*  Read Lines from File and Read Random Line from File sub-actions, input validation input was not working correctly
*  Creating/editing reward sub-actions when there are none could cause a potential crash
*  Fix culture parsing of decimals for streamlabs and stream elements testing of donations, decimals should work for all cultures now
*  Potential crash in some sub-actions and empty scenes
*  Drag/drop of sub-action was not properly marking cached info as dirty
*  Voice control UI was not selecting the saved input device on startup
*  Issues with Twitch dropping connection, this maybe an on going fix, trying to refine why this behaviour is happening.  This manifests as if the bot stops reacting to most Twitch actions.

*  Streamlabs donation events were being ignored, they should go through now
*  Resuming a queue should now correctly fire off any actions that were in the queue
*  Masimum values for max redeems per user/per stream are set to correct maximums now, should no longer cause a crash
*  Data type mismatch when creating Stream Markers (oops)
*  Exporting actions with a queue did not preserve is the queue was blocking
*  Importing actions did not correctly show blocking/non-blocking queue info (visual only)
*  Custom websocket server firing incorrect actions

## Details

## DonorDrive
You can add either your team, or personal campaign for ExtraLife, StackUp or any other charity that uses DonorDrive, and attach an action to a donation event.

This is not limited to just 1, you can add multiple as well.

More info to be filled in.

## Inline Function
Up until now, the only thing that could be parsed were `%variables%`, I have finally added the first function to this, `$math()$`.

Anywhere there is full parsing, you can now perform math operations, and also use variable within the math function itself.

Here is just a simple example of an action:
* Set Argument `%x%` to `1`, `%x%` is now 1
* Set Argument `%x%` to `$math(%x%+1)$`, incrememnt `%x%` by `1`, `%x%` is now `2`
* Set Argument `%x%` to `$math(%x%^2)$`, set `%x%` to `%x%` to the power of `2`, `%x%` is now `4`
* Set Argument `%x%` to `$math(%x%*16)$`, set `%x%` to `%x%` times `16`, `%x%` is now `64`

A page with the possible usages of the `math` function will be added as well, as it is more then just your basic arithmetic (yes, you can even do derivatives or integrals if you wanted to).

## New Way to Pick Actions

With this update, I've completely removed the mess of dropdowns to select events.  This was slowing down the application with the amount of updates this could generate to keep track of any changes to your actions.

There is now a clickable button that will bring up a dialog with your actions grouped and sorted like they are on the main actions page.  This dialog is very much a WIP, and will evolve over time.

In addition to events, most dialogs where you picked actions (Commands, Channel Reward, Timed Actions, etc) have also received this update.

As an added bonus, most of the lists where you edit these kinds events, now have a new context menu item to be able to change the action without having to go in and edit the command, reward, etc.

## Set Argument

With the addition of the `$math()$` inline function, the **Set Argument** sub-action has been updated to fully support parsing its value, and the Increment option has been removed, as you can now use the math function to do this.

> A configuration upgrade will happen, converting any Set Argument that is flagged as increment will have its value converted to `$math(Variable+Value)$`, there is the possibility this may not fully work, so it is advised to check any Set Arguments you have that were converted.

## New Hot Keys and Keyboard Presses

A few new keys were added to be the list of keys usable for Hot Keys and Keyboard Press

* Semi Colon `;:`
* Forward Slash `/?`
* Tilde `~`
* Opening Square Brace `[{`
* Backslash `\|`
* Closing Square Brace `]}`
* Double Quote `"`
* Comma `,<`
* Minus Sign `-_`
* Period `.>`
* Plus Sign `+=`
* Break
* Scroll Lock
* Media Next Track
* Media Previous Track
* Media Stop
* Media Play/Pause
* Media Volume Mute
* Media Volume Down
* Media Volume Up

## Twitch Clip C# Methods

Previously, the C# calls to get Twitch clips, only allowed getting all the clips, leaving it upto you to sort through them afterwards.  If there were many clips for a user, this could take a while to fetch, and as it wsa a paginated call, it was only grabbing 20 at a time leading to further slow down.

The first fix, it now fetches 100 at a time (the maximum allowed per call),  This means, ever paged call takes approximately 800 milliseconds to complete.

The methods for fetching clips have been updated to allow for a count to be specified, and it will only grab that many clips for a user, default sorted newest to oldest.

They have also been updated to specific a date range (start and end date) to look for clips, as well as a day timespan, to specifiy the past 7 days, or the past 30 days, etc.

```csharp
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, DateTime start, DateTime end);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, DateTime start, DateTime end, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, TimeSpan duration);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(int userId, TimeSpan duration, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string userName, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string username, DateTime start, DateTime end);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string username, DateTime start, DateTime end, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string username, TimeSpan duration);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForUser(string username, TimeSpan duration, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, DateTime start, DateTime end);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, DateTime start, DateTime end, int count);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, TimeSpan duration);
List<ClipData> GetClipsForGame(int gameId, TimeSpan duration, int count);
```

## New Action Wide Variables

If Twitch is connected, actions will have the following five variables available to them

Name | Description
----:|:------------
| `%broadcastUser%` | The Twitch display name of the broadcast account |
| `%broadcastUserName%` | The Twitch user name of the broadcast account |

void ObsReplayBufferStop(int connection = 0);
void ObsReplayBufferSave(int connection = 0);
```

### OBS Get Scene Item Properties

New sub-action that will make a `GetSceneItemProperties` call to the websocket, and much like OBS Raw, will add the results into your arguments in the form of `props.<path>`

#### New C# Methods for OBS Get Scene Item Properties
```csharp
string ObsGetSceneItemProperties(string scene, string source, int connection = 0);
```

### Run Commercial
