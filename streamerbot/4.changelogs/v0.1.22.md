## Fixes
::changelog-list{type=fix}
* Fix Twitch authentication error (non-critical), caused by additional scope request.
::


## Details
This is a hot-fix for `0.1.21` to fix a non-critical (workarounds were available) issue with Twitch Authentication, and requesting new scopes.

Seems I forgot to apply a change after updating the status indicator to still show the Twitch Broadcaster/Bot status after new scopes are required.
