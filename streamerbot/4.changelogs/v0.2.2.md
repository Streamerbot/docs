Welcome to Streamer.bot 0.2.2.  While some might have been following the changelogs for the alpha releases, sadly, this is not alpha being promoted to stable.

Due to some issues with 3rd party integrations causing crashes, this version has been fast tracked with some fixes and updates to get everyone up and running again.

The alpha versions that folks have been following, will live on in the future version of 0.2.3-alpha, with a slightly smaller changelog, as the following is quite hefty

## Details
### Streamer.bot
After much back and forth and general annoyance, I can now digitally sign Streamer.bot, Speaker.bot, and all the accompanying libraries.

Starting with this alpha, alpha-16, Streamer.bot and libraries are now digitally signed.

What does this mean? I'm hoping less (or no more) false positives and/or AV software nuking the exe before or while its running. Also, building a better level of trust.
Startup Performance Improvements
Yes, that's right, found a few more areas that were behaving a bit slow during startup, and handled them better.

This mainly affected users with a long list of actions and/or commands.

Also, some of the startup tweaks that were in the alpha releases has been brought over to this release.
### MIDI
In debugging the MIDI services, it appears there was a line left in (copy/pasta) that assigned a midi in/out device a new internal id when it was edited, this should not have been doing that

This is likely the cause of MIDI Trigger links to become broken, as well as breaking the main list of midi devices, and not being able to open it after editing it.
