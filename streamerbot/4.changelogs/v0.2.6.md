## Details
Most of the fixes/changes going into this release can be considered a hot fix release, which is why it is going straight to stable release.
### Twitch
The `upgrade` code for `Twitch Message`, `Reply To Message` and `Announcement` sub-actions had a bug, which was unfortuantely missed during the beta releases.  Due to this bug, the new settings were all set to send from bot with fallback to broadcaster, regardless of what you had configured as the `Preferred Account`.

In order for the fix to correct this, you will need to use a data file from `0.2.4` when upgrading again, i.e., `0.2.4` => `0.2.6`, there is no way around this.  Data files from `0.2.5` have already had the upgrade applied and old data removed, and cannot be fixed.
### Streamer.bot Website
In `0.2.5`, the `Auto Update` will not function unless you are logged in to the `Streamer.bot Website Integration`.  This was an oversight stemming from an internal fix, and was not caught, as using the `beta` requires you to be logged in.  This has been fixed in `0.2.6` and will work as it's intended moving forward.

In order to update from `0.2.5`, you will need to either update **manually**, or you can login to the `Streamer.bot Website Integration`, and perform an `Auto Update`
