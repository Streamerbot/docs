## Details
Most of the fixes/changes going into this release can be considered a hot fix release, which is why it is going straight into `beta`
### YouTube
With 0.2.4 and the Multi Broadcast support feature, you could now monitor any type of broadcast, so you can do testing while not live. Monitoring a broadcast that is not live consumes the same amount of quota as a broadcast that is live, and there are no mechanisms in place to stop monitoring a non-live broadcast.

Starting with 0.2.5, in order to help limit quota usage, any non-live broadcast if monitored, will be un-monitored after 10 minutes. If you still need to do testing, etc, you can always monitor the broadcast again.

This is mostly in place for those that might monitor a broadcast, and forget to monitor it, and it runs for hours.
### Meld Studio
I couldn't wait till `TwitchCon` any longer, so, for those that have been asking for it, it's finally here. Meld Studio integration!

A very important note, Meld Studio is still a work in progress application, as such, so is the integration for it. It is something that will evolve over time as more and more features are added and exposed for 3rd party tools to take advantage of.

There are 10 new sub-actions:
* Get Current Scene
* Show Scene
* Get Status
* Recording
* Streaming
* Take Screenshot
* Set Layer Visibility State
* Set Effect Enabled State
* Set Layer Track Muted State
* Set Track Muted State
There are also 8 new triggers:
* Connected
* Disconnected
* Recording Started
* Recording Stopped
* Streaming Started
* Streaming Stopped
* Scene Changed
* Event
#### C# Methods
A connection index of `-1` is the fall back to `Default`
```cs
int MeldStudioGetConnectionByName(string name);
bool MeldStudioIsConnected(int connectionIdx = -1);
bool MeldStudioConnect(int connectionIdx = -1);
void MeldStudioDisconnect(int connectionIdx = -1);
bool MeldStudioShowScene(string sceneId, int connectionIdx = -1);
bool MeldStudioShowSceneByName(string sceneName, int connectionIdx = -1);
bool MeldStudioShowLayerByName(string sceneName, string layerName, int connectionIdx = -1);
bool MeldStudioHideLayerByName(string sceneName, string layerName, int connectionIdx = -1);
```
### Streamer.bot Chat
This release brings a new `WebSocket` server mode to `Streamer.bot Chat`, allowing it to function in any web browser environment. 

**Yes!**, this includes OBS custom browser docks, and even remote mobile devices for those of you savvy enough to setup tunnelling to your `Streamer.bot WebSocket Server` 😉

#### Limitations
* Much work has been done to reduce the limitations of chat when using the `WebSocket Server` mode. However, you will notice that many direct moderation actions are disabled in `WebSocket` mode. You can still work around this with your own quick actions.
* Configuration settings are **separate** from the main chat application. Though this may be more of a feature than a limitation depending on the user 😄
* You can now sync settings from the main Streamer.bot chat window to `WebSocket` windows in `Settings` -> `General`

#### There will be bugs
Some things are very much still a work in progress, and some event payloads are still being updated to catch up with recent Streamer.bot application changes.

#### Streamer.bot Configuration
* The Streamer.bot WebSocket Server must be enabled
* To send chat messages, you must also enable authentication
### Elgato WaveLink
Thanks to some of the error reports, I was able to spot some unusual data coming from `Elgato WaveLink` when making certain calls, this is now hopefully being handled.
### Folder Watcher
The new option, `Add Changed Data`, which defaults to `true`, will add changed data withini the `File Watcher Changed` event.  If you do not need the changed data in this event, or you know for a fact that the files are binary, it is highly recommended to uncheck this option.
### Pending Action Cache
A restart is **REQUIRED** after enabling or disabling this labs feature, and by default, it is **disabled**.

This labs feature will, on close, write to a database any outstanding pending actions. `Pending` actions are `actions` that have not yet run, and are waiting to run, either because they're in a **blocking queue**, or a queue that is **paused**.

When **Streamer.bot** is started, if this cache file is present, it will **auto load** in any actions that have been cached, as well, it will pause the queue that they belong to. In addition, an argument will be added, `wasCached`, this will be set to `true`; during normal operation, this variable will not exist.

This feature is very experimental, and I need feedback on it, for options, capabilities, etc.

A caveat to note, due to the nature of serializing/deserializing, not all data types will preserved. Ones that I am aware of are `List<T>` objects, these will become `object[]` arrays when loaded.
#### NOTE
Consider this feature experimental, and hopefully will evolve over time. Keep in mind, being a lab feature, does not guarantee it will get added as full fledged feature.
### YouTube
During some testing, I noticed the Poll closed event was actually coming through in the data, so this is wired up.
### Twitch
Added 2 new sub-actions with this release, `Get Active Poll`, and `Get Active Prediction`.  Both of these sub-actions will add an argument `active` that is either `true` or `false`.  If this is `false`, then there is currently **no** running poll or prediction.  If it is `true`, then the data for the poll or prediction will be added to the arguments, in the same format as the triggers.

There is a new sub-action, `Twitch Create Prediction`. Yes, that means you can finally use the UI to create a prediction instead of relying on C# code to do this.  Much like the `Twitch Create Poll` sub-action, all fields support variables and methods, this includes the outcomes.
### Gift Bombs and Gift Subs
For a while, the `Gift Sub` and `Gift Bomb` events have been giving users intermittent troubles, and after looking more in depth at some verbose logs, I think I was finally able to solve most, if not all the issues with these events. Hopefully moving forward, these events are a bit more reliable.

Just to re-iterate how and when these events fire:
* A `user` in your chat **directly** gifts another user in your chat a sub, this will trigger a `Twitch Gift Sub` event
* A `user` in your chat gifts **1** random sub, this will trigger a `Twitch Gift Sub` event
* A `user` in your chat gifts **2** or more subs, this will trigger a `Twitch Gift Bomb` event, and if `Ignore Gift Subs from Bombs` is not enabled, it will also trigger a `Twitch Gift Sub` for every gifted sub.

Some new variables have been added to the `Gift Sub` and `Gift Bomb` event.
* `random` - Whether or not this was a targeted `Gift sub`, this will only be true for single gift subs that were directly given to a user.
* `systemMessage` - The system message that was put into Twitch Chat.
* `totalSubsGiftedShared` - A boolean value if the user gifting the sub(s) shares there total gift count.
`random` is only available in the Twitch `Gift Sub` event, while the rest are available in both events
### Send Message, Reply to Message and Twitch Announce
`Send Message`, `Reply To Message`, `Twitch Announce` sub-actions received a small update. Prior to `0.2.5`, you needed to specify a `preferred` account to use, either the `Broadcaster`, or the `Bot`. If the `preferred` account was the `Bot` account, and it was not connected, it would fallback to the `Broadcaster` account.

These 2 sub-actions have done away with the `preferred` account, and have 2 new options, `Send using Bot account`, and `Fallback to Broadcaster`. How these options work is outline below:
* If `Send using Bot account` is checked, and `Fallback to Broadcaster` is checked, this is the same behaviour as if you had Bot as your preferred account
* If `Send using Bot account` is checked, and `Fallback to Broadcaster` is not checked, it will try to send using only the `Bot` account, and do nothing if it can't (i.e, not logged in)
* If `Send using Bot account` is not checked, then it will send using the `Broadcaster` account

A configuration upgrade is also in place, it will convertt any `Twitch Send Message`/`Twitch Reply To` sub-actions to the new format, and if `Bot` was the preferred account, then both new settings will be checked
#### Shared Chat
Twitch recently released the Shared Chat feature/capability, and support for it is being added to `0.2.5`.

With `beta.12`, support for the new `source` tags has been added to `Twitch Chat Message` events. And at the moment, this data is only exposed to `Chat Message` and `Cheer` triggers. `Commands`, `pyramids` and `first words` are still being worked on, and should be available for use in a shared chat in a future beta version.

Payloads for various existing `Twitch EventSub` events have been updated to handle the new `Shared Chat` data, but at the moment, this data is not exposed yet, as there are quite a few events to work through and figure out.

Finally, the 3 new events for `Shared Chat`, `Begin`, `Update` and `End`, have been added as new Triggers

`Commands` received a new source, `Twitch Shared Chat`, this will allow you to handle commands from other chats within a `Shared Chat Session`

**13** new events/triggers were added, that hopefully will be working with `Twitch's` new `Shared Chat` feature.
#### New Shared Chat Triggers
* Shared Chat Announcement
* Shared Chat Pay It Forward
* Shared Chat Prime Paid Upgrade
* Shared Chat Gift Paid Upgrade
* Shared Chat Sub
* Shared Chat Resub
* Shared Chat Sub Gift
* Shared Chat Gift Bomb (Community Sub Gift)
* Shared Chat Ban
* Shared Chat Unban
* Shared Chat Timeout
* Shared Chat Untimeout
* Shared Chat Message Deleted
#### Predictions
To round out the `Prediction` sub-actions, there are **4** new sub-actions that can be used to interact with the current active prediction.
* Cancel Active prediction
* Lock Active prediction
* Resolve Active Prediction
* Resolve Active Prediction by Title
#### C# Methods
The C# methods have also been updated. The only thing that has changed, is a new optional parameter fallback to introduce the same behaviour in the sub-action
```cs
The new signatures for them are
void SendMessage(string message, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
void TwitchReplyToMessage(string message, string replyId, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
void SendAction(string action, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
```
Twitch Shield Mode Methods
```cs
bool TwitchShieldModeOn();
bool TwitchShieldModeOff();
```
These changes will be transparent, and will only need updating if you wish to change the behavior
#### Reward Redemptions
Reward Redemption events have had **5** variables added to them, they are:
* `skipsQueue` - Whether or not the Reward is auto completed when redeemed
* `requiresUserInput` - Whether or not the Reward requires user input
* `maxPerStream` - How many redemptions can be done per stream, 0 is disabled
* `maxPerUserPerStream` - How many redemptions a user can make during a stream, 0 is disabled
* `globalCooldown` - The global cooldown of the Reward in seconds
### Groups
Groups got a bit of an update, there are now events, and triggers associated with them.
#### New Triggers
* Group Added
* Group Removed
* Group Cleared
* Group Users Added
* Group Users Removed
### Streamlabs Website
This is a breaking change, since `Streamlabs` is making it harder for new users to retrieve their API token, I've finally switched it over to an `OAuth` type Authentication.

The UI for Streamlabs has been updated with the common login and client connections.

If you are using the Streamlabs integration, be sure to login after starting `0.2.5` to continue receiving events
### Streamlabs Desktop
The `Streamlabs Desktop` integration has been updated to support `Horizontal` and `Vertical` sources.  In order to better handle these sources and just overall tracking, an internal session is kept of your `Streamlabs`, and almost all events are handled to keep it updated in real time.

Unfortunately, `Groups` are completely broken in `Streamlabs Desktop`.  They do not emit any data changes, nor do they have unique enough IDs to be able to figure out which belongs to `Horizontal` or `Vertical`. Also, there is no way via WebSocket to enable/disable, or perform any sort of actions or transforms on them.  TLDR; use nested `Scenes` for better control.

The following `C# Methods` have been updated.
```cs
bool SlobsIsSourceVisible(string scene, string source, StreamlabsDesktopOutputType output = StreamlabsDesktopOutputType.Both, int connection = 0);
void SlobsSetSourceVisibility(string scene, string source, bool visible, StreamlabsDesktopOutputType output = StreamlabsDesktopOutputType.Both, int connection = 0);
void SlobsSetSourceVisibilityState(string scene, string source, int state, StreamlabsDesktopOutputType output = StreamlabsDesktopOutputType.Both, int connection = 0);
void SlobsShowSource(string scene, string source, StreamlabsDesktopOutputType output = StreamlabsDesktopOutputType.Both, int connection = 0);
void SlobsHideSource(string scene, string source, StreamlabsDesktopOutputType output = StreamlabsDesktopOutputType.Both, int connection = 0);
void SlobsHideGroupsSources(string scene, string groupName, StreamlabsDesktopOutputType output = StreamlabsDesktopOutputType.Both, int connection = 0);
string SlobsSetRandomGroupSourceVisible(string scene, string groupName, StreamlabsDesktopOutputType output = StreamlabsDesktopOutputType.Both, int connection = 0);
```
The `StreamlabsDesktopOutputType` enum
```cs
public enum StreamlabsDesktopOutputType
{
    Both = 0,
    Horizontal = 1,
    Vertical = 2
}
```
### New C# Methods
There is a new overload method for `TriggerCodeEvent`
```cs
void TriggerCodeEvent(string eventName, string json);
```
This method accepts a json string, that **Streamer.bot** will parse itself. The reason for this, is because of the way the C# code is handled and kept separate, you can not use your own object types within a `Dictionary` that you pass to the other methods of this, or use `JObject`, `JArray` types

New C# Method for Getting a list of commands
```cs
List<CommandData> GetCommands();
```
`CommandData` class
```cs
public class CommandData
{
`public Guid Id { get; set; }
public string Name { get; set; }
public bool Enabled { get; set; }
public string Group { get; set; }
public int Mode { get; set; }

public List<string> Commands { get; set; }
public string RegexCommand { get; set; }

public bool CaseSensitive { get; set; }

public List<string> Sources { get; set; }
`}
```
### Custom Event Trigger Sub-action
This new trigger allows you to Trigger a Custom Event from within a sub-action. Previously you had to use the C# method, `TriggerEvent(string eventName, bool useArgs = true)`. This will allow you to trigger any `Custom Event` triggers that are created.
### mtion Studio
Time for a new feature, with `0.2.5` we're introducing a basic integration for `mtion studio`.

There are 2 new sub-actions that can be used
* Get Active Clubhouse
* Send Trigger
This integration is a bit different, as there is no service to connect to, if you wish to use it, just add either of these sub-actions
### OBS
There was a bug that popped up in the beta series for `0.2.5` after making a serialization change to how **Streamer.bot** handles it's events internally. I was finally able to track this down to the OBS series of events, and because of this, I have changed the data structure for these events.

This data structure is mainly used for **Streamer.bot's** Websocket, so if you subscribe to any OBS events, they will be a bit different.

This is what the base JS data will be for any OBS Event, some will have additional information.
```js
{
    "timeStamp": "2024-09-09T19:43:35.1226962-04:00",
    "event": {
        "source": "Obs",
        "type": "<event here>"
    },
        "data": {
        "connection": {
            "id": "edaf6e6e-5040-487e-8ac2-0d5720610e14",
            "host": "<host>",
            "name": "<name>",
            "version": "<version>",
            "websocketVersion": "<version>"
        }
    }
}
```
If you were relying on any `OBS events` from **Streamer.bot's** Websocket, take note, the data has changed, and this is a breaking change.
### WebSocket
With the release of `0.2.5` the payload for a `Twitch Chat Message`, and `Cheer` are changing. The `Message` property will stay for backwards compatibility, but is now deprecated, and will be removed in a future version, please update and code to use the new payload data.

The new payload format is still being tweaked, and should be finalized by the time `0.2.5` hits stable, so if you are using these 2 events, feedback is welcome.

Added a handful of new `WebSocket` requests, these will allow you to get `Global Variables`, as well as `User Variables`.
* GetGlobals
* GetGlobal
* TwitchGetUserGlobals
* TwitchGetUserGlobal
* YouTubeGetUserGlobals
* YouTubeGetUserGlobal
* TrovoGetUserGlobals
* TrovoGetUserGlobal
#### Authentication
With `0.2.5`, the `WebSocket Server` has a new Authentication option, this uses the same authentication method that `OBS WebSocket` uses.

When connecting to Streamer.bot's WebSocket, you will receive a hello msg, regardless if authentication is enabled or not, this new packet, will contain an info object, that contains the same information from a GetInfo request.

If authentication is enabled, there will be an authentication object that contains a salt and a challenge string. You will use these 2 values, as well as the password to create an Authenticate request.
```js
{
"id": "<some_id_string>",
"request": "Authenticate",
"authentication": "<authentication_string>"
}
```

You will need to send the above request back to Streamer.bot in order to authenticate. To build the authentication string, you will need to do the following:
* Concatenate the WebSocket password with the salt provided by the server (password + salt)
* Generate an SHA256 binary hash of the result and base64 encode it.
* Concatenate the base64 secret with the challenge sent by the server (base64_secret + challenge)
* Generate a binary SHA256 hash of that result and base64 encode it.
* The resulting string is what you will use for authentication.
The docs will be updated to describe these steps in more/better detail.

Also note, there is a new option, `Enforce for All Requests`, when this is enabled, the `WebSocket` is expecting an `Authenticate` request as your first message, if any other request is performed, the socket will be closed. There is also a 30s timeout, where it expects this request be sent, before automatically closing the socket.

The `Streamer.bot Client` is updated to support this new authentication method.
### MIDI
The validation checks performed in the Midi Event Settings dialog have been fixed, which means you can only specify a channel from `1` to `16` if `Ignore Channel` is not checked, and data value of `1` to `255` if `Ignore Data` is not checked
### Code Signing
It's coming up on a year since obtaining a Code Signing certificate, and I have renewed the certificate today. So moving forward, any new releases, will be using the new certificate.

What this means for older releases once the certificate expires, nothing, as they are properly timestamped, they will continue to function as normal.
