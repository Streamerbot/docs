## Details
Most of the fixes/changes going into this release can be considered a hot fix release, which is why it is going straight into `beta`
### Elgato WaveLink
Thanks to some of the error reports, I was able to spot some unusual data coming from `Elgato WaveLink` when making certain calls, this is now hopefully being handled.
### Folder Watcher
The new option, `Add Changed Data`, which defaults to `true`, will add changed data withini the `File Watcher Changed` event.  If you do not need the changed data in this event, or you know for a fact that the files are binary, it is highly recommended to uncheck this option.
### Twitch
Added 2 new sub-actions with this release, `Get Active Poll`, and `Get Active Prediction`.  Both of these sub-actions will add an argument `active` that is either `true` or `false`.  If this is `false`, then there is currently **no** running poll or prediction.  If it is `true`, then the data for the poll or prediction will be added to the arguments, in the same format as the triggers.
