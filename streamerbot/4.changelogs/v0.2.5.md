## Details
Most of the fixes/changes going into this release can be considered a hot fix release, which is why it is going straight into `beta`
### YouTube
With 0.2.4 and the Multi Broadcast support feature, you could now monitor any type of broadcast, so you can do testing while not live. Monitoring a broadcast that is not live consumes the same amount of quota as a broadcast that is live, and there are no mechanisms in place to stop monitoring a non-live broadcast.

Starting with 0.2.5, in order to help limit quota usage, any non-live broadcast if monitored, will be un-monitored after 10 minutes. If you still need to do testing, etc, you can always monitor the broadcast again.

This is mostly in place for those that might monitor a broadcast, and forget to monitor it, and it runs for hours.
### Meld Studio
I couldn't wait till `TwitchCon` any longer, so, for those that have been asking for it, it's finally here. Meld Studio integration!

A very important note, Meld Studio is still a work in progress application, as such, so is the integration for it. It is something that will evolve over time as more and more features are added and exposed for 3rd party tools to take advantage of.

There are 10 new sub-actions:
* Get Current Scene
* Show Scene
* Get Status
* Recording
* Streaming
* Take Screenshot
* Set Layer Visibility State
* Set Effect Enabled State
* Set Layer Track Muted State
* Set Track Muted State
There are also 8 new triggers:
* Connected
* Disconnected
* Recording Started
* Recording Stopped
* Streaming Started
* Streaming Stopped
* Scene Changed
* Event
### Elgato WaveLink
Thanks to some of the error reports, I was able to spot some unusual data coming from `Elgato WaveLink` when making certain calls, this is now hopefully being handled.
### Folder Watcher
The new option, `Add Changed Data`, which defaults to `true`, will add changed data withini the `File Watcher Changed` event.  If you do not need the changed data in this event, or you know for a fact that the files are binary, it is highly recommended to uncheck this option.
### Twitch
Added 2 new sub-actions with this release, `Get Active Poll`, and `Get Active Prediction`.  Both of these sub-actions will add an argument `active` that is either `true` or `false`.  If this is `false`, then there is currently **no** running poll or prediction.  If it is `true`, then the data for the poll or prediction will be added to the arguments, in the same format as the triggers.

There is a new sub-action, `Twitch Create Prediction`. Yes, that means you can finally use the UI to create a prediction instead of relying on C# code to do this.  Much like the `Twitch Create Poll` sub-action, all fields support variables and methods, this includes the outcomes.
### Gift Bombs and Gift Subs
For a while, the `Gift Sub` and `Gift Bomb` events have been giving users intermittent troubles, and after looking more in depth at some verbose logs, I think I was finally able to solve most, if not all the issues with these events. Hopefully moving forward, these events are a bit more reliable.

Just to re-iterate how and when these events fire:
* A `user` in your chat **directly** gifts another user in your chat a sub, this will trigger a `Twitch Gift Sub` event
* A `user` in your chat gifts **1** random sub, this will trigger a `Twitch Gift Sub` event
* A `user` in your chat gifts **2** or more subs, this will trigger a `Twitch Gift Bomb` event, and if `Ignore Gift Subs from Bombs` is not enabled, it will also trigger a `Twitch Gift Sub` for every gifted sub.

Some new variables have been added to the `Gift Sub` and `Gift Bomb` event.
* `random` - Whether or not this was a targeted `Gift sub`, this will only be true for single gift subs that were directly given to a user.
* `systemMessage` - The system message that was put into Twitch Chat.
* `totalSubsGiftedShared` - A boolean value if the user gifting the sub(s) shares there total gift count.
`random` is only available in the Twitch `Gift Sub` event, while the rest are available in both events
### Send Message, Reply to Message and Twitch Announce
`Send Message`, `Reply To Message`, `Twitch Announce` sub-actions received a small update. Prior to `0.2.5`, you needed to specify a `preferred` account to use, either the `Broadcaster`, or the `Bot`. If the `preferred` account was the `Bot` account, and it was not connected, it would fallback to the `Broadcaster` account.

These 2 sub-actions have done away with the `preferred` account, and have 2 new options, `Send using Bot account`, and `Fallback to Broadcaster`. How these options work is outline below:
* If `Send using Bot account` is checked, and `Fallback to Broadcaster` is checked, this is the same behaviour as if you had Bot as your preferred account
* If `Send using Bot account` is checked, and `Fallback to Broadcaster` is not checked, it will try to send using only the `Bot` account, and do nothing if it can't (i.e, not logged in)
* If `Send using Bot account` is not checked, then it will send using the `Broadcaster` account

A configuration upgrade is also in place, it will convertt any `Twitch Send Message`/`Twitch Reply To` sub-actions to the new format, and if `Bot` was the preferred account, then both new settings will be checked
#### C# Methods
The C# methods have also been updated. The only thing that has changed, is a new optional parameter fallback to introduce the same behaviour in the sub-action
```cs
The new signatures for them are
void SendMessage(string message, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
void TwitchReplyToMessage(string message, string replyId, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
void SendAction(string action, bool useBot = true, bool fallback = true);
```
These changes will be transparent, and will only need updating if you wish to change the behavior
### Groups
Groups got a bit of an update, there are now events, and triggers associated with them.
#### New Triggers
* Group Added
* Group Removed
* Group Cleared
* Group Users Added
* Group Users Removed
### New C# Methods
There is a new overload method for `TriggerCodeEvent`
```cs
void TriggerCodeEvent(string eventName, string json);
```
This method accepts a json string, that **Streamer.bot** will parse itself. The reason for this, is because of the way the C# code is handled and kept separate, you can not use your own object types within a `Dictionary` that you pass to the other methods of this, or use `JObject`, `JArray` types

New C# Method for Getting a list of commands
```cs
List<CommandData> GetCommands();
```
`CommandData` class
```cs
public class CommandData
{
`public Guid Id { get; set; }
public string Name { get; set; }
public bool Enabled { get; set; }
public string Group { get; set; }
public int Mode { get; set; }

public List<string> Commands { get; set; }
public string RegexCommand { get; set; }

public bool CaseSensitive { get; set; }

public List<string> Sources { get; set; }
`}
```
### Custom Event Trigger Sub-action
This new trigger allows you to Trigger a Custom Event from within a sub-action. Previously you had to use the C# method, `TriggerEvent(string eventName, bool useArgs = true)`. This will allow you to trigger any `Custom Event` triggers that are created.
### mtion Studio
Time for a new feature, with `0.2.5` we're introducing a basic integration for `mtion studio`.

There are 2 new sub-actions that can be used
* Get Active Clubhouse
* Send Trigger
This integration is a bit different, as there is no service to connect to, if you wish to use it, just add either of these sub-actions
### OBS
There was a bug that popped up in the beta series for `0.2.5` after making a serialization change to how **Streamer.bot** handles it's events internally. I was finally able to track this down to the OBS series of events, and because of this, I have changed the data structure for these events.

This data structure is mainly used for **Streamer.bot's** Websocket, so if you subscribe to any OBS events, they will be a bit different.

This is what the base JS data will be for any OBS Event, some will have additional information.
```js
{
    "timeStamp": "2024-09-09T19:43:35.1226962-04:00",
    "event": {
        "source": "Obs",
        "type": "<event here>"
    },
        "data": {
        "connection": {
            "id": "edaf6e6e-5040-487e-8ac2-0d5720610e14",
            "host": "<host>",
            "name": "<name>",
            "version": "<version>",
            "websocketVersion": "<version>"
        }
    }
}
```
If you were relying on any `OBS events` from **Streamer.bot's** Websocket, take note, the data has changed, and this is a breaking change.
