# Heart Rate Pulse
Pulsoid heart rate pulse trigger.

## Details
This event triggers every second while using a heart rate monitor.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
When Pulsoid is broadcasting your heart rate, this event can fire once every second, so be sure whatever action you use runs fast enough so it won't cause a backlog in an action queue.  It is also recommended that whatever action you are running be placed in a blocking queue.
