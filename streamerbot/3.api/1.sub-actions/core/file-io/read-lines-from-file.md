## Overview
Using this sub-action, you can load the entire contents of a file into your action, each line will be added as a new variable, `%line#%` where `#` would be from 0 to n-number of lines in the file.

## Configuration
### Parse Variables
If this option is selected, when reading in the lines, if there are any `%variables%` present, they will be parsed for you.

For example, you have a file of welcome messages, that consist of `Welcome %user%`, with variations on that, the `%user%` would be replaced when reading the file.

### Attempt Auto-typing
While reading the contents of the file, an attempt will be made on each line to auto-type it.  So if it's a number, it will make sure the variable contains a number type.

## Variables
Name | Description
----:|:------------
`lineCount` | The amount of lines the file has.
`line#` | Change the `#` to the line number e.g. if you have 3 lines it wil output: `line0`, `line1`, `line2` 
`fileFound` |  This can be used to see if the file is present. Returns true or false.

> The line count number starts at 0. E.g. if your line count is 20, your `line#` will go from 0-19.
