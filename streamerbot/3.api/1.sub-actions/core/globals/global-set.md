## Overview
![logic-global-set.png](/logic-global-set.png =400x)

## Configuration
### Destination

This sub-action stores data in one of the `Global` data stores, valid options are `Global` & `User`
`User` context is further subdivided into `Redeemer` & `Target`

User Context | Description
-----|-----
`Redeemer`| Store data for the user activating the action
`Target`| Store data for the current `targetUser` - Used in conjunction with the [Get Info for Target](/Sub-Actions/Twitch/Get-User-Info-for-Target) sub-action

### Persisted

Data can be stored in a `Temporary` store or a `Persisted` store. Persisted data will be saved to the `Globals.dat` file in the `Data` folder. Data saved in this way will survive application restarts. 

### Variable Name

This is the name of the `Global` / `User` variable to write to
> This should always be in `camelCase` i.e. with a lower case initial letter, Streamer.bot can not retrieve data from any store if the initial letter is capitalised
{.is-warning}

### Content

The final line provides space to define what to store in the named `Global`
This has 3 modes:

Mode | Description
-----|-----
`Value`| Store the entered value, exactly as written 
`Increment`| Take the current global value and add the specified value to it (only works for integers)
`Argument` | Store the contents of a named active argument (do not include the % symbols)
