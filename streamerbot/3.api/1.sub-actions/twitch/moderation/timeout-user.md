::note
**Moderators**
<br>
Timing out a moderator will automatically reassign their moderator status once the timeout period ends. Editors will not receive their editior rights back.
<br><br>
This only applies to the subaction. 
<br><br>
The C# method does not reassign their moderator status. You'll need to implement your own logic in C# to handle this.
