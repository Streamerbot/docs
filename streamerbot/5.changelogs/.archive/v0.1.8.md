## Details

### YouTube Integration
Probably one of the most requested features has finally been added, more details will be added to this section over the next few days.

You'll be able to authorize with your YouTube account, and monitor chat, giving you the ability to react to chat messages, super chat, super stickers and more!

More information will follow!

See [YouTube](/Platforms/YouTube) for information on how to get started!

### 64-bit Build
Moving forward, **Streamer.bot** will be offered in a 64-bit build, as opposed to a 32-bit build. This opens up the ability to interface with more librariries and tools using the integrated C# capabilities.

### Twitch New Scopes
When you connect with your broadcaster account, the following new scopes will be requested

* `moderator:manage:banned_users`
* `moderator:read:blocked_terms`
* `moderator:manage:blocked_terms`
* `moderator:manage:automod`
* `moderator:read:automod_settings`
* `moderator:manage:automod_settings`
* `moderator:read:chat_settings`
* `moderator:manage:chat_settings`
* `whispers:edit`
* `user:read:follows`

Since I needed to add the moderation scopes, I decided to finally add the whisper edit scope, this will allow the broadcaster account to send whispers.  The restrictions by twitch are still in place!

### New C# Methods
Add the following new C# methods

#### User Variables
```csharp
T GetTwitchUserVar<T>(string userName, string varName, bool persisted = true);
T GetYouTubeUserVar<T>(string userName, string varName, bool persisted = true);
void SetTwitchUserVar(string userName, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void SetYouTubeUserVar(string userName, string varName, object value, bool persisted = true);
void UnsetTwitchUserVar(string userName, string varName, bool persisted = true);
void UnsetYouTubeUserVar(string userName, string varName, bool persisted = true);
void UnsetTwitchUser(string userName, bool persisted = true);
void UnsetYouTubeUser(string userName, bool persisted = true);
```

#### YouTube Methods
```csharp
void SendYouTubeMessage(string message);
```

#### Actions
```csharp
bool RunActionById(string actionId, bool runImmediately = true);
```

#### Websocket Custom Servers
```csharp
int WebsocketCustomServerGetConnectionByName(string name);
```

### OBS Connections
OBS connections have 2 new properties in the context menu when you :kbd{value="Right-Click"} on them, Default and Forced.

Setting a connection to default means if the OBS Websocket an OBS sub-action is using is not found, it will use the default selected OBS connection.

Setting a connection to forced, will override all OBS sub-actions and OBS C# methods to use this connection until it is toggled off, or **Streamer.bot** is restarted.

### Streamer.bot Website Integration
Decks, it's all about Decks!  With this integration, Decks can now be fully remote!  They can be opened on any browser, any device, anywhere in the world and control your **Streamer.bot** through button presses.

Under the `Integrations` tab, there is a new `Streamer.bot Website` tab, :kbd{value="Left-Click"} the `Settings` tab and connect to the **Streamer.bot Website**, this uses the same login mechanism that you used to sign into the website to create your Decks

Expect more things to come with this new feature!

A huge thanks to Whipstickgostop for getting the website side of things all working!

### Kofi Integration
A long asked for integration is finally here, you'll be able to react to events that come from Kofi!

Since Kofi uses WebHooks, this functionality is done through the **Streamer.bot** website, and configured there.

> This **REQUIRES** you to be connected to the Streamer.bot Website to use
{.is-info}

### Patreon Integration
You can now react to Patreon events as they happen!

Patreon also uses WebHooks, so this is done through the **Streamer.bot** website as well.

> This **REQUIRES** you to be connected to the Streamer.bot Website to use

### VoiceMod Integration
With 0.1.8, you'll be able to select voices, and change options of VoiceMod from within **Streamer.bot**

The following new Sub-Actions are available:
* Get Current Voice
* Select Voice
* Select Random Voice
* Set Censor State
* Set Hear My Voice State
* Set Mute State
* Set Voice Changer State

New C# Methods available for use.

```csharp
void VoiceModSelectVoice(string voiceId);
string VoiceModGetCurrentVoice();
bool VoiceModGetHearMyselfStatus();
bool VoiceModHearMyVoiceOn();
bool VoiceModHearMyVoiceOff();
bool VoiceModGetVoiceChangerStatus();
bool VoiceModVoiceChangerOn();
bool VoiceModVoiceChangerOff();
void VoiceModCensorOn();
void VoiceModCensorOff();
```
## [Pulsoid](https://pulsoid.net/?from=streamerbot) Integration

**Streamer.bot** now has a direct integration with Pulsoid, attach an action to the Heart Rate Pulse event to receive your heart rate events.

The Heart Rate event happens every second while data is being transmitted from Pulsoid, be aware of this.

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`%measuredAt%` | Time the measurement was taken
`%heartRate%` | Heart Rate value

### HypeRate Integration
**Streamer.bot** now has a direct integration with HypeRate.io, attach an action to the Heart Rate Pulse event to receive your heart rate events.

The Heart Rate event happens every second while data is being transmitted from HypeRate, be aware of this.

Name | Description
----:|:------------
`%heartRate%` | Heart Rate value

### StreamElements
The need to find and enter your JWT token are gone.  You can now authenticate with StreamElements to give **Streamer.bot** access to your account to use features from this service.

If you were using StreamElements prior to this version, you will need to login in order to resume functionality.

### PolyPop Integration
Requires the plugin [PolyPop WebSocket Plugin](https://github.com/Jabbey92/PolyPopWebsocketPlugin/releases/tag/1.0) from Jabbey92 in order to work.

Once configured, you'll be able to trigger PolyPop alerts from within **Streamer.bot** using the PolyPop Trigger Alert sub-action

### TipeeeStream Integration
Assign an action to donations that are sent through TipeeeStream

### TreatStream Integration
Assign an action to whenever someone sends you a treat through TreatStream!

### Action Queues
A brand new tab at the top level, `Action Queues` has been added, you'll be able to find your Queues here now, instead of a drop down on the `General` tab under `Settings`.  You'll be able to add, create, delete your queues, pause them, resume them from here as well.

In addition to this, there are 2 additional tabs under `Action Queues`; `Pending Actions` and `Action History`

#### Pending Actions
Here you will be able to see **Streamer.bot** working, showing you actions as they get queued up, and when they start running.

:kbd{value="Right-Click"} on an Action will let you inspect the variables that the action was run with.

#### Action History
Here you will be able to see actions that have complete, along with how long it took for them to run.

:kbd{value="Right-Click"} on an action will bring up a context menu, letting you inspect the variables this action was run with, inspecting the variables after it was completed, as well as requeuing the action as if it was just ran.

### New Sub-Actions
#### Obs Hide Scene Sources
Much like it's counter part, Obs Hide Group sources, this will hide all the sources within a scene.

#### Obs Set Random Scene Source Visible
Much like it's counter part, Obs Set Random Group Source Visible, this will set a random source within a scene to visible.

#### Set Voice Control Command State
Set the state of a Voice Control Command, either enable it or disable it, or toggle its current state.

#### Set Voice Control Command
