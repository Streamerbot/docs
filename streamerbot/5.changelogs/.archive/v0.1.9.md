## New C# Methods

```csharp
void TwitchAnnounce(string message, bool bot = false, string color = null);
```
> Even though the color parameter is present, currently, due to a Twitch limitation, only null is supported, this will use the default announce command.  When Twitch fixes this, supported values will be `blue`, `orange`, `green`, `purple`
{.is-warning}

```csharp
string TwitchPredictionCreate(string title, List<string> options, int duration);
```

## Updated C# Methods

### Twitch Reward C# Methods
The following methods have had there return value changed from void to bool, to indicate success or failure.

```csharp
bool UpdateRewardTitle(string rewardId, string title);
bool UpdateRewardPrompt(string rewardId, string prompt);
bool UpdateReward(string rewardId, string title = null, string prompt = null, int? cost = null);
```

Any use of these methods should be uneffected, as calling without using the bool is the same as calling a void method, the result is just thrown away

## Updated Sub-actions

### Logic If/Else

The Logif If/Else sub-action got a bit smarter, you can now have an else condition.

## New Sub-actions

### Send Announcement to Channel

With this sub-action you can send an /announce to your channel.  While there is a drop down to pick the color, this is disabled on purpose, as the color specific commands currently do not work outside of the main Twitch chat.  Once this is enabled on Twitch's side, I will enable this dropdown

> Due to a Twitch limitation, only the default announce command is currently supported.  When Twitch fixes this, the other colors (`blue`, `orange`, `green`, `purple`) will be supported.

### Get Reward Info

This sub-action will add information about the selected reward to the arguments
