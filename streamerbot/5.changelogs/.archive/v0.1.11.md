## Details
### OBS Websocket v5.x
Support for OBS Websocket v5.0 comes to **Streamer.bot** v0.1.11.  For the most part this is a transparent change for users, just edit your OBS Websocket within **Streamer.bot** and change to v5.x.

Unfortunately, the OBS Raw sub-action will not work between v4.9.x and v5.x; the methods to obtain and set information are incompatible.  Even having a translation layer on this leaves too much to chance and likely have the wrong output.

> OBS Raw Sub-action will not be compatible between the 2 versions
{.is-warning}

More information on upgrading your OBS Raw sub-actions will be forthcoming.

The new OBS Raw format for OBS Websocket v5.x is the following:
```json
{
  "requestType": "request method",
  "requestData": { ... }
}
```

#### Get Scene Item Properties Sub-Action

A quick note about this sub-action, while I tried to keep data structures the same between the 2 versions, the data for this one unfortunately changed. There is now a common format for the data

```json
{
  "name": "name",
  "itemId": 0,
  "visible": true,
  "locked": false,
  "transform": {
    "alignment": 0,
    "boundsAlignment": 0,
    "boundsHeight": 0.0,
    "boundsType": "string",
    "boundsWidth": 0.0,
    "cropBottom": 0,
    "cropLeft": 0,
    "cropRight": 0,
    "cropTop": 0,
    "height": 0.0,
    "positionX": 0.0,
    "positionY": 0.0,
    "rotation": 0.0,
    "scaleX": 0.0,
    "scaleY": 0.0,
    "sourceHeight": 0.0,
    "sourceWidth": 0.0,
    "width": 0.0
  }
}
```

### Lumia Stream
**Streamer.bot** gains another integration, Lumia Stream! You can now connect to Lumia Stream and set light colors from within **Streamer.bot**

### Loot Devil
Some have been asking for it, well now it's here, you can connect Loot Devil to **Streamer.bot** now!  To use this, requires the use of the **Streamer.bot** website to configure the web hook, and connecting the application to the website to receive gifting events.

* `moderator:manage:announcements`
