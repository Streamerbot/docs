## Details
### Twitch
There were a few issues when handling `Twitch Resubscription` events, related to parsing the `EventSub` data that I missed, these have been fixed and tested, and work properly now

`Chat Messages` no longer come from the `Chat Client`, they now come from `EventSub`, this means that all events for **Speaker.bot** for Twitch come from the EventSub connection now.
