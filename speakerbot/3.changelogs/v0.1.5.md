## Details
### Streamlabs Website
This is a breaking change, since `Streamlabs` is making it harder for new users to retrieve their API token, I've finally switched it over to an `OAuth` type Authentication.

The UI for Streamlabs has been updated with the common login and client connections.

If you are using the Streamlabs integration, be sure to login after starting `0.1.5` to continue receiving events
### Twitch
Updating to EventSub, and just cleaning up in general, new scopes are required on your account.
* `user:read:chat`
* `user:read:whispers`
* `moderator:read:warnings`

With the removal of `PubSub` Twitch Community Goal events will no longer function, these are the `GoalContribution` and `GoalFinished` events. For whatever reason, `Twitch` has not brough these events forward to EventSub, and there is no other means of handling them atm.
