## Details
## Twitch
Updating to EventSub, and just cleaning up in general, new scopes are required on your account.
* `user:read:chat`
* `user:read:whispers`
* `moderator:read:warnings`
Moving these events over means there is only one event left being handled by the main `Chat` client, which is messages, and there are two events being handled by `PubSub`, the Community Goal events.
