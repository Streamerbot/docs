## Details

### TwitchSpeaker has finally gained an icon!
Yes, that's correct, TwitchSpeaker is no longer the default icon, it has its own identity now.

### WebSocket Server
With v0.0.49 you'll now be able to control TwitchSpeaker with a WebSocket connection.
> This is just the initial addition of this capability, I already have plans to expand this out, so for now, I would recommend not adding feature requests surrounding this feature.
{.is-info}

The settings for this are under `Settings` -> `WebSocket Server`, be sure to set auto start to enabled, so it'll run when you start TwitchSpeaker.

Request format
```json
{
    "request": "<command>",
    "id": "0",
}
```
Much like **Streamer.bot**, **TwitchSpeaker** follows the same request format, where `request` is the command you wish to perform, and `id` is some identifier or nonce.

Commands available: `Speak`, `Pause`, `Resume`, `Clear`, `Stop`, `Off`, `Disable`, `On`, `Enable`, `Events`, `Mode`

#### Speak
This is probably the command that will be used the most, this will make TwitchSpeaker speak the `message` you want, using the `voice` specified
```json
{
    "request": "Speak",
    "id": "0",
    "voice": "EventVoice",
    "message": "This is a test message",
    "badWordFilter": true/false // optional
}
```

#### Pause, Resume, Clear, Stop, Off, Disable, On, Enable
These commands have no parameters, so the basic request can be used.

#### Events
This will let you enable or disable events being spoken
```json
{
    "request": "Events",
    "id": "0",
    "state": "[on|off]"
}
```

#### Mode
This will let you change the speaking mode, from everything, to a command
```json
{
    "request": "Mode",
    "id": "0",
    "mode": "[all|command]"
}
```
::callout{color=amber icon=i-mdi-lightbulb}
If there are no commands already setup, switching to command, will return a failure response
::


### New UDP Commands
There are 3 new UDP commans

```json
{ "command": "set", "method": "sticky", "value": true/false }
{ "command": "set", "method": "nickname", "username": "%user%", "nickname": "somestring" }
{ "command": "assign", "method": "last", "username": "%user%" }
```
