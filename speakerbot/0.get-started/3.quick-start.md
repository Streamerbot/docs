::steps{level=2}

## Create a Voice Alias
::navigate
Navigate to **Settings > Voice Aliases** in Speaker.bot
::

Enter a `Name` for your alias and select your desired output device.

For the purposes of this guide, I recommend leaving the output device set to `Application Default`, which will use your current default audio output device.

::success
`Test Speak` at the bottom of the view should now successfully speak the test message.
::

## Enable Global TTS
::navigate
Navigate to **Settings > General** in Speaker.bot
::

1. Ensure the `Enabled` checkbox is checked.
    - This toggles the TTS engine on or off globally.
2. Select a `Default Voice Alias`
    - Choose the voice alias you created in the previous steps

## Test TTS from Twitch
**Your Speaker.bot instance should now be ready to speak commands from Twitch chat!**

1. Open Twitch Chat for the account you authenticated with Speaker.bot
2. Enter the command `!say test` :copy-button{content="!say test"}

::success
If everything is working, Speaker.bot should have spoken "Test"!
