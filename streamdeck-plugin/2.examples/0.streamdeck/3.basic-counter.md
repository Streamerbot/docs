title: Basic Counter
---

Create a simple counter, with controls for incrementing and resetting the current value.

![Basic Counter Example](/img/basic-counter.png)

For this example, we will be utilizing the [Action Button](/guide/keys#action) and the [Status Indicator](/guide/keys#status-indicator)

## Setup

::list{type="info"}
- In **Streamer.bot:**
::

![Basic Counter Example](/img/basic-counter-1.png)

1. Create a new action, we will call ours `SD Counter Value`
2. Add a new sub-action, `Stream Deck -> Set Value`
3. Set Button ID to `%targetButtonId%`
4. Set Value to `%value%`

::list{type="info"}
- In the **Stream Deck software:**
::

We're going to be creating **three** buttons on the Stream Deck, outlined below:


![Basic Counter Example](/img/basic-counter-2.png)

1. Assign a Streamer.bot `Status Indicator` button to your desired location
2. Set `Type` to `Value`
3. Set `Current Value` to `0`
4. (Optional) Modify the indicator appearance as preferred.
5. Copy the `Button ID` for the next steps


![Basic Counter Example](/img/basic-counter-3.png)

1. Assign a Streamer.bot `Action` button to your desired location.
2. Modify the button appearance as desired, we will set ours to a plus icon `https://api.iconify.design/mdi:plus-box-outline.svg?color=%23ae00ff`
3. Select your Streamer.bot Instance
4. Select the action you created earlier, in our case `SD Counter Value`
5. Add a string argument named `value` with a value of `+=1`
6. Add a string argument named `targetButtonId`, with a value containing the `Button ID` copied from the indicator button you created in the previous steps.


![Basic Counter Example](/img/basic-counter-4.png)

1. Assign a Streamer.bot `Action` button to your desired location.
2. Modify the button appearance as desired, we will set ours to a refresh icon `https://api.iconify.design/mdi:refresh.svg?color=%23ae00ff`
3. Select your Streamer.bot Instance
4. Select the action you created earlier, in our case `SD Counter Value`
5. Add a string argument named `value` with a value of `0`
6. Add a string argument named `targetButtonId`, with a value containing the `Button ID` copied from the indicator button you created in the previous steps.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-check-circle color=green}
You can now press the increment and reset buttons to control your count indicator!

## Tips & Tricks

::list{type="success"}
- In this example, we made use of dynamic arguments to keep the Streamer.bot setup extremely simple!
- We could complete this example with only **one** button:
    - Use the `Key-Down` action on the status indicator as our increment action
    - Use the `Key-Down (Long Press)` action on the status indicator as our reset action
