Streamer.bot `v0.1.21` or later is **required**
::

Follow the steps below to allow your Streamer.bot instance to communicate with the Stream Deck Software.

## Enable Stream Deck Server

You must first enable the Stream Deck integration in Streamer.bot.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-navigation}
**In Streamer.bot**, navigate to `Integrations > Elgato > Stream Deck`
::

::field-group
  ::field{name=Address type=Text default="127.0.0.1"}
    The host address for the Stream Deck server

    - Default `127.0.0.1`

    ::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
    If you want to connect from another machine on your network, try `0.0.0.0`
    ::
  ::
  ::field{name=Port type=Number default="8059"}
  The port used for the Stream Deck server

  - Default `8059`
  ::
  ::field{name="Auto Start" type=Toggle default=True}
  Automatically start the Stream Deck server when Streamer.bot starts up
  ::
::

Click `Start Server` to ensure the integration is enabled and running.

## Configure an Instance

If you've installed the Stream Deck plugin, you should now see the `Streamer.bot` category on the right-hand side of your Stream Deck Software.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-lightbulb color=amber}
If you are having trouble finding the newly installed plugin, you may need to **restart** your Stream Deck software
::

The first time you use the plugin, you will have no Streamer.bot instances configured.

To configure your first instance, follow the instructions below:

1. Drag a Streamer.bot key to your desired slot in the Stream Deck Software
2. Click the instance drop down to view your available instances
3. Click `Configure Instances` to add a new instance
4. Enter the `host` and `port` of your `Stream Deck` server integration in Streamer.bot
5. Click `Save`!

::callout{icon=i-mdi-check-circle color=green}
Your Stream Deck is now connected to your Streamer.bot instance!
::

## Migration Notes
Important information for users migrating from the old Stream Deck plugin

This plugin has a new identifier, `bot.streamer.streamdeck`, allowing it to  function **side-by-side** with the [previous plugin](https://github.com/nate1280/streamdeck-Streamer.bot/releases){target=_blank}, `nate1280.streamerbot`.

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert-circle color=red}
There is **no** direct migration path other than recreating buttons with the new plugin.
::
::callout{icon=i-mdi-check-circle color=green}
You **do not** need to delete or recreate your old buttons, unless you plan on uninstalling the old plugin.
::
::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
If you keep both plugins installed, you will have **two** `Action` buttons available under Streamer.bot, one for each version of the plugin.
::

#### Uninstall
When you are ready to uninstall the old plugin, you can follow the steps below:

::callout{icon=i-mdi-alert color=amber}
**Do not proceed** unless you are sure you want to remove the previous plugin!
::

- In the Stream Deck Software, right-click the **old** `Action` button and select `Uninstall`.
    - Alternatively, you can navigate to `%APPDATA%/Elgato/StreamDeck` and delete the `nate1280.streamerbot.streamDeckPlugin` folder.
- Restart the Stream Deck Software
