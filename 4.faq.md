### 1. Why can I no longer assign an action to an event?
Since update v0.2.0, the actions are no longer assigned in the event, but the other way round. In the *Actions* tab, you will now find a *Triggers* area in which you can select an event/trigger like commands or a subscription for the respective action.

### 2. Is it possible to have a dynamic delay for the duration of the TTS?
Once version v0.2.3 goes live (currently in alpha), there will be an option to have that. As for now, you can stick to an estimated delay that counts the characters of the text.

[See an example on Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/834650675224248362/877868281363562496/1027679486763880468)
### 3. My TTS is speaking twice, why's that?
On rare occasions the UDP broadcast can cause SpeakerBot to speak twice. The next version of StreamerBot (v0.2.3, currently in alpha) will add a websocket speak subaction that won't cause this issue. As for now, a PC restart will fix this. You can also switch to websocket speak subactions via C#, 

[See an example on Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/834650675224248362/878250435125841940/1171661691042414622)
### 4. Why is my StreamerBot not connecting to OBS?
This can happen for various reasons. First of all make sure that *Enable WebSocket server* is checked in OBS. If StreamerBot and OBS are running on the same PC, use `127.0.0.1` as the IP address, otherwise make sure the Server IP matches (Port number and password have to match as well). If on the same network you can also just deactivate authentication. In rare cases the default port `4455` is already occupied, in that case try to change it to something else, like `4456` or `1234`. Last but not least, make sure to choose `v5.x` on the connection in StreamerBot.
### 5. How do I run a random subaction?
Option 1- Right-Click an action and check *Random*, so a single subaction within the action is being picked randomly. Option 2- you can create a group within the subactions, then Right-Click that group and check *Random*. This will then only run a random subaction **within** the group. All the other subactions in the action outside the group will run from top to bottom as usual.
### 6. How do I know which variables are available?
The easiest way would be to check out <https://docs.streamer.bot/> and look for the trigger or subaction you are using. A full list of variables will be given there, e.g. 
[*Twitch Follow* trigger](https://docs.streamer.bot/api/triggers/twitch/channel/follow). 
A second method would be to run the action, then go into the *Action Queues* tab, into the *Action History* and then Double-Click the action that has completed. This will give you all variables that have been populated for that action, with their values.
### 7. Why is my trigger blue?
A blue trigger means it *always runs*. This usually goes for triggers that have their criteria set to *Any* (like the *Twitch Subscription* trigger that has everything checked and will fire for all sub tiers). If you have a second *Twitch Subscription* trigger that only has *tier 3* checked, this one obviously won't always run but only does for tier 3 subs. In this case, both the triggers will fire on a tier 3 sub, but only the first one does on a tier 1 sub.
### 8. How do I get the profile picture or game of a Twitch user?
Those variables are being populated by the *Get User Info For Target* subaction (`Twitch -> User`). For *Source Type* you can then choose between different sources. *User* is the one who redeems the trigger (e.g. the one who follows on a *Follow* trigger or uses the command on a *Command Triggered* trigger). *From Input* uses the `%rawInput%` as the target, so the command  `!command nate1280` would populate the variables for user *nate1280*. Just make sure the command location is set to *Start* in its settings. You can also choose *Variable* and type a variable like `%randomUser0%` in there if you have a preceding *Add Random Viewer* subaction.
### 9. How do I prevent my actions from overlapping/running multiple times at once?
Go into the *Action Queues* tab, then into *Queues* and create a new queue (`Right-Click -> Add`). Give it any name you like and check *Blocking*. Now go back into your *Actions* tab and assign the queue to all the actions you want in there by editing the action (Doube-Click the action or Right-Click -> Edit). Now the upcoming actions will only start running once the previous one has finished.
### 10. Can I run multiple subactions at once instead of one by one?
By Right-Clicking an action, you can check *Concurrent*. This will cause subactions to all run at the same time instead of going from top to bottom as usual.
### 11. How do if/else-subactions work?
Below is a simple flowchart that shows how they work.

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/834650675740540941/1081280562569936976/if_else_streamerBot.png?ex=65d8e27f&is=65c66d7f&hm=82c8b080e8fb8efd37576ad8221c706fdab3aa3e12b3a2c6ba3fedb172c389a1&=&format=webp&quality=lossless&width=763&height=643)
### 12. How can I exclude bots/certain users from an action like *First Words*?
For the most cases, this can be accomplished by an if/else-subaction (`Core -> Logic -> If/Else`). To goal is to check for the username and if it matches, break the action (`if user equals (Ignore Case) TheUserName break, else continue`). See the example below.

![](https://i.imgur.com/aySJPDH.png)

You can also make use of groups (`Settings -> Groups`) and check if a user is in a group and break the action if they are (see [**13.**](<https://linkto14.com>))
### 13. How do check if a user in a group?
This can be done with C#. Create a subaction (`Core -> C# -> Execute C# Code`) and paste the code below in there. Replace *group1*  with the name of your group. Hit *Save and Compile* afterwards. This will provide the `%inGroup%` variable, that you can then check against in an if/else-subaction (`if inGroup equals True continue, else break`).


```cs
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        
        string userId = args["userId"].ToString();
        string groupName = "group1";
        bool inGroup = CPH.UserIdInGroup(userId,groupName);
        CPH.SetArgument("inGroup",inGroup);
        return true;
    }
}```
### 14. Can the bot send whispers?
Yes, though this can only be done with C# (`Core -> C# -> Execute C# Code`). Note that there are certain requirements and limitations when it comes to whispers: to send a whisper you need a verified phone number (so does your bot if you are sending it with the bot account), whisper limits can be seen [here](<https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/#rate-limits>). You will **not** be able to see whether a whisper has been sent successfully.

This code example sends a whisper to the user who is redeeming a command:

```cs
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        
        string user = args["user"].ToString();
        string message = "Hello, this is a test whisper message!";
        CPH.SendWhisper(user, message, true); //set "true" to "false" if you want to send the whisper with your broadcaster account
        return true;
    }
}```
### 15. Can I get a dynamic delay of an OBS media source?
Yes, this can be done with OBS Raw (`OBS -> Raw`) and a [GetMediaInputStatus request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#GetMediaInputStatus>). Paste the code below into the Raw subaction and replace the inputName with the name of your media source. This request will populate a `%obsRaw.mediaDuration%` variable that gives the media duration in milliseconds. You can then use that variable within the *Delay* subaction.

```json
{
  "requestType": "GetMediaInputStatus",
  "requestData": {
    "inputName": "Your Media Source"
  }
}
```

__Note__: For the variable to populate, the media source needs to be visible. Use a *Set Source Visibility State* subaction to make it visible, add a delay of 100ms and then use the Raw subaction. See the example below:

        CPH.SetArgument("inGroup",inGroup);
        return true;
    }
}```
### 16. Can StreamerBot change the settings within a filter (like Move Value or Move Source)?
This can be done with an OBS Raw subaction (`OBS -> Raw`) and a [SetSourceFilterSettings request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#SetSourceFilterSettings>). To find out what the correct settings for a request are called, you can manually set the settings on your filter and do a [**Get**SourceFilter request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#GetSourceFilter>) beforehand. This will give you the list of settings.

In this example:

![](https://i.imgur.com/DLDHeyo.png)

a GetSourceFilter request for a *Move Value* filter with a *Type Writer* effect on a text source was done and returned `"settings_text"`. So we use that in our **Set**SourceFilterSettings request like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/zODVEtJ.png)



You can also use variables within the request (__Note__: If you click "Test" on the Raw subaction, the variable **WILL NOT** be populated. In that case you will have to test the entire action).


```json
{
  "requestType": "SetSourceFilterSettings",
  "requestData": {
    "sourceName": "Test Text Source",
    "filterName": "Move Value",
    "filterSettings": {
      "setting_text": "%user% said: %rawInput%"
    },
    "overlay": true
  }
}
```

This can also be done for filters on a scene, but you won’t be able to select it on the OBS Raw website. In that case, do a request in a subaction, use the scene name as the sourceName and hit “Test”.
### 1. Why can I no longer assign an action to an event?
Since update v0.2.0, the actions are no longer assigned in the event, but the other way round. In the *Actions* tab, you will now find a *Triggers* area in which you can select an event/trigger like commands or a subscription for the respective action.

This can be done with an OBS Raw subaction (`OBS -> Raw`) and a [SetSourceFilterSettings request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#SetSourceFilterSettings>). To find out what the correct settings for a request are called, you can manually set the settings on your filter and do a [**Get**SourceFilter request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#GetSourceFilter>) beforehand. This will give you the list of settings.

In this example:

![](https://i.imgur.com/DLDHeyo.png)

a GetSourceFilter request for a *Move Value* filter with a *Type Writer* effect on a text source was done and returned `"settings_text"`. So we use that in our **Set**SourceFilterSettings request like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/zODVEtJ.png)



You can also use variables within the request (__Note__: If you click "Test" on the Raw subaction, the variable **WILL NOT** be populated. In that case you will have to test the entire action).


```json
{
  "requestType": "SetSourceFilterSettings",
  "requestData": {
    "sourceName": "Test Text Source",
    "filterName": "Move Value",
    "filterSettings": {
      "setting_text": "%user% said: %rawInput%"
    },
    "overlay": true
  }
}
```

This can also be done for filters on a scene, but you won’t be able to select it on the OBS Raw website. In that case, do a request in a subaction, use the scene name as the sourceName and hit “Test”.
### 12. How can I exclude bots/certain users from an action like *First Words*?
For the most cases, this can be accomplished by an if/else-subaction (`Core -> Logic -> If/Else`). To goal is to check for the username and if it matches, break the action (`if user equals (Ignore Case) TheUserName break, else continue`). See the example below.

![](https://i.imgur.com/aySJPDH.png)

You can also make use of groups (`Settings -> Groups`) and check if a user is in a group and break the action if they are (see [**13.**](13.check-if-user-in-group.md))
### 14. Can the bot send whispers?
Yes, though this can only be done with C# (`Core -> C# -> Execute C# Code`). Note that there are certain requirements and limitations when it comes to whispers: to send a whisper you need a verified phone number (so does your bot if you are sending it with the bot account), whisper limits can be seen [here](<https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/#rate-limits>). You will **not** be able to see whether a whisper has been sent successfully.

This code example sends a whisper to the user who is redeeming a command:

```cs
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        
        string user = args["user"].ToString();
        string message = "Hello, this is a test whisper message!";
        CPH.SendWhisper(user, message, true); //set "true" to "false" if you want to send the whisper with your broadcaster account
        return true;
    }
}
```
### 1. Why can I no longer assign an action to an event?
Since update v0.2.0, the actions are no longer assigned in the event, but the other way round. In the *Actions* tab, you will now find a *Triggers* area in which you can select an event/trigger like commands or a subscription for the respective action.

### 2. Is it possible to have a dynamic delay for the duration of the TTS?
Once version v0.2.3 goes live (currently in alpha), there will be an option to have that. As for now, you can stick to an estimated delay that counts the characters of the text.

[See an example on Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/834650675224248362/877868281363562496/1027679486763880468)
### 3. My TTS is speaking twice, why's that?
On rare occasions the UDP broadcast can cause SpeakerBot to speak twice. The next version of StreamerBot (v0.2.3, currently in alpha) will add a websocket speak subaction that won't cause this issue. As for now, a PC restart will fix this. You can also switch to websocket speak subactions via C#, 

[See an example on Discord here](https://discord.com/channels/834650675224248362/878250435125841940/1171661691042414622)
### 4. Why is my StreamerBot not connecting to OBS?
This can happen for various reasons. First of all make sure that *Enable WebSocket server* is checked in OBS. If StreamerBot and OBS are running on the same PC, use `127.0.0.1` as the IP address, otherwise make sure the Server IP matches (Port number and password have to match as well). If on the same network you can also just deactivate authentication. In rare cases the default port `4455` is already occupied, in that case try to change it to something else, like `4456` or `1234`. Last but not least, make sure to choose `v5.x` on the connection in StreamerBot.
### 5. How do I run a random subaction?
Option 1- Right-Click an action and check *Random*, so a single subaction within the action is being picked randomly. Option 2- you can create a group within the subactions, then Right-Click that group and check *Random*. This will then only run a random subaction **within** the group. All the other subactions in the action outside the group will run from top to bottom as usual.
### 6. How do I know which variables are available?
The easiest way would be to check out <https://docs.streamer.bot/> and look for the trigger or subaction you are using. A full list of variables will be given there, e.g. 
[*Twitch Follow* trigger](https://docs.streamer.bot/api/triggers/twitch/channel/follow). 
A second method would be to run the action, then go into the *Action Queues* tab, into the *Action History* and then Double-Click the action that has completed. This will give you all variables that have been populated for that action, with their values.
### 7. Why is my trigger blue?
A blue trigger means it *always runs*. This usually goes for triggers that have their criteria set to *Any* (like the *Twitch Subscription* trigger that has everything checked and will fire for all sub tiers). If you have a second *Twitch Subscription* trigger that only has *tier 3* checked, this one obviously won't always run but only does for tier 3 subs. In this case, both the triggers will fire on a tier 3 sub, but only the first one does on a tier 1 sub.
### 8. How do I get the profile picture or game of a Twitch user?
Those variables are being populated by the *Get User Info For Target* subaction (`Twitch -> User`). For *Source Type* you can then choose between different sources. *User* is the one who redeems the trigger (e.g. the one who follows on a *Follow* trigger or uses the command on a *Command Triggered* trigger). *From Input* uses the `%rawInput%` as the target, so the command  `!command nate1280` would populate the variables for user *nate1280*. Just make sure the command location is set to *Start* in its settings. You can also choose *Variable* and type a variable like `%randomUser0%` in there if you have a preceding *Add Random Viewer* subaction.
### 9. How do I prevent my actions from overlapping/running multiple times at once?
Go into the *Action Queues* tab, then into *Queues* and create a new queue (`Right-Click -> Add`). Give it any name you like and check *Blocking*. Now go back into your *Actions* tab and assign the queue to all the actions you want in there by editing the action (Doube-Click the action or Right-Click -> Edit). Now the upcoming actions will only start running once the previous one has finished.
### 10. Can I run multiple subactions at once instead of one by one?
By Right-Clicking an action, you can check *Concurrent*. This will cause subactions to all run at the same time instead of going from top to bottom as usual.
### 11. How do if/else-subactions work?
Below is a simple flowchart that shows how they work.

### 12. How can I exclude bots/certain users from an action like *First Words*?
For the most cases, this can be accomplished by an if/else-subaction (`Core -> Logic -> If/Else`). To goal is to check for the username and if it matches, break the action (`if user equals (Ignore Case) TheUserName break, else continue`). See the example below.

![](https://i.imgur.com/aySJPDH.png)

You can also make use of groups (`Settings -> Groups`) and check if a user is in a group and break the action if they are (see [**13.**](13.check-if-user-in-group.md))
### 13. How do I check if a user is in a group?
This can be done with C#. Create a subaction (`Core -> C# -> Execute C# Code`) and paste the code below in there. Replace *group1*  with the name of your group. Hit *Save and Compile* afterwards. This will provide the `%inGroup%` variable, that you can then check against in an if/else-subaction (`if inGroup equals True continue, else break`).


```cs
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        
        string userId = args["userId"].ToString();
        string groupName = "group1";
        bool inGroup = CPH.UserIdInGroup(userId,groupName);
        CPH.SetArgument("inGroup",inGroup);
        return true;
    }
}```
### 14. Can the bot send whispers?
Yes, though this can only be done with C# (`Core -> C# -> Execute C# Code`). Note that there are certain requirements and limitations when it comes to whispers: to send a whisper you need a verified phone number (so does your bot if you are sending it with the bot account), whisper limits can be seen [here](<https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/irc/#rate-limits>). You will **not** be able to see whether a whisper has been sent successfully.

This code example sends a whisper to the user who is redeeming a command:

```cs
using System;

public class CPHInline
{
    public bool Execute()
    {
        
        string user = args["user"].ToString();
        string message = "Hello, this is a test whisper message!";
        CPH.SendWhisper(user, message, true); //set "true" to "false" if you want to send the whisper with your broadcaster account
        return true;
    }
}
```
### 15. Can I get a dynamic delay of an OBS media source?
Yes, this can be done with OBS Raw (`OBS -> Raw`) and a [GetMediaInputStatus request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#GetMediaInputStatus>). Paste the code below into the Raw subaction and replace the inputName with the name of your media source. This request will populate a `%obsRaw.mediaDuration%` variable that gives the media duration in milliseconds. You can then use that variable within the *Delay* subaction.

```json
{
  "requestType": "GetMediaInputStatus",
  "requestData": {
    "inputName": "Your Media Source"
  }
}
```

__Note__: For the variable to populate, the media source needs to be visible. Use a *Set Source Visibility State* subaction to make it visible, add a delay of 100ms and then use the Raw subaction. See the example below: 

![](https://i.imgur.com/mSk7leg.png)


### 16. Can StreamerBot change the settings within a filter (like Move Value or Move Source)?
This can be done with an OBS Raw subaction (`OBS -> Raw`) and a [SetSourceFilterSettings request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#SetSourceFilterSettings>). To find out what the correct settings for a request are called, you can manually set the settings on your filter and do a [**Get**SourceFilter request](<https://obs-raw.streamer.bot/#GetSourceFilter>) beforehand. This will give you the list of settings.

In this example:

![](https://i.imgur.com/DLDHeyo.png)

a GetSourceFilter request for a *Move Value* filter with a *Type Writer* effect on a text source was done and returned `"settings_text"`. So we use that in our **Set**SourceFilterSettings request like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/zODVEtJ.png)



You can also use variables within the request (__Note__: If you click "Test" on the Raw subaction, the variable **WILL NOT** be populated. In that case you will have to test the entire action).


```json
{
  "requestType": "SetSourceFilterSettings",
  "requestData": {
    "sourceName": "Test Text Source",
    "filterName": "Move Value",
    "filterSettings": {
      "setting_text": "%user% said: %rawInput%"
    },
    "overlay": true
  }
}
```

This can also be done for filters on a scene, but you won’t be able to select it on the OBS Raw website. In that case, do a request in a subaction, use the scene name as the sourceName and hit “Test”.
